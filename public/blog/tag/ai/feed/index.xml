										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation is excited to partner with Delphi Labs to co-host a new accelerator program for high-potential projects at the intersection of AI and Web3. The new cohort will launch in October and teams with a strong vision for decentralized AI applications and infrastructure are encouraged to <a href="https://www.hzn.xyz/">apply</a>.</p>



<p>Building on the success of NEAR’s first <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-foundation-launches-ai-incubation-program">AI x Web3 incubator</a>, the NEAR x Delphi Labs AI Accelerator will provide participating founders and teams with the technical, operational, and financial resources to succeed—including access to $50k in compute credits, advisory support from the NEAR co-founders, funding opportunities beginning at $100k, and token launch support.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hzn.xyz/"><strong>Applications are open</strong></a><strong> until October 4 for teams interested in joining the accelerator</strong>, which begins on October 14.</p>



<p>NEAR Foundation and Delphi Labs share the common strategic vision of a <a href="https://near.org/blog/user-owned-ai-is-near">User-Owned AI</a> ecosystem, built on Web3 rails, that provides genuinely better alternatives to developers and users than the prevailing model of centralized AI controlled by big tech companies. The goal is to maximize the benefits of AI for people and communities—and minimize the potential risks—by putting the power of AI where it belongs: in the hands of users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR is a leading blockchain platform designed to accelerate the development of decentralized applications with a focus on usability and scalability—co-founded by Illia Polosukhin, one of the originators of the transformer architecture underpinning the present AI surge. The NEAR ecosystem vision for <a href="https://near.org/blog/user-owned-ai-is-near">User-Owned AI</a> includes building a community of aligned teams where innovations are shared openly, ensuring consistency and interoperability across projects. It also includes supporting development of the robust, open infrastructure needed to build and deploy AI applications on a decentralized network, ensuring that the future of AI is not only owned by users but is scalable, secure, and efficient for businesses and founders.</p>



<p><a href="https://delphilabs.io/">Delphi Labs</a>, a research and development firm specializing in Web3 and DeFi, brings to the accelerator a deep understanding of blockchain technology and a strong track record of supporting successful projects. </p>



<p>“Crypto x AI is the sector we’re most excited about and, given how early it is, we thought it made a lot of sense for an accelerator cohort,” explains Delphi Labs co-founder José Macedo. “NEAR is the ideal partner given that Illia is one of the original co-authors of the transformer paper and has an unparalleled understanding and network within AI.” The Delphi team’s conviction is that competitive dynamics will result in a world of millions of AI models and that Web3 is the ideal substrate for this many-model world. They are interested in finding exceptional founders who have a strong vision for how Web3 can benefit from AI, or how AI can benefit from Web3, and want to rapidly execute on this vision.</p>



<p>NEAR and Delphi are co-designing the upcoming accelerator cohort experience, slated to begin October 14 with a live kickoff gathering planned. Each participating team will receive mentorship, resources, and opportunities for investment: $100k in investment from NEAR Foundation, along with $50k in compute credits, and potential investment of up to $250k from Delphi Labs for further incubation or acceleration following the completion of the program. The program culminates mid-December at an investor-focused demo day with several top funds and angels in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR’s first AI x Web3 incubator cohort, which ran from June to August 2024, saw participants achieve significant early milestones while contributing essential pieces to the growing User-Owned AI stack. These milestones include: <a href="https://hyperbolic.xyz/">Hyperbolic</a> hosting the latest open source AI models, including Llama 3.1 405B; <a href="https://mizu.global/">Mizu</a> launching their beta platform and attracting 20K users in the first week; and <a href="https://cryptopond.xyz/">Pond</a> launching their first GNN model for wallet predictions and achieving a 20% prediction rate. The teams have built on the momentum from the incubator to attract serious seed funding interest, with Hyperbolic successfully closing a $7M round.</p>



<p>In addition to the NEAR x Delphi Labs AI Accelerator Program, the NEAR Foundation has also teamed up with <a href="https://www.betaworks.com/camp#about-camp">Betaworks</a> on an in-person acceleration cohort in New York City focused on consumer AI applications in the Web2 space. Running through November 2024, the Betaworks collaboration welcomes a wider roster of projects into the growing User-Owned AI ecosystem and opens further opportunities for bridging the Web3 x AI space to Web2 consumer AI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Web3 have been two of the hottest topics of 2023. There has been significant interest in how the two technology ecosystems may converge in the coming years, with lots of interest from investors.</p>



<p>For NEARCON ‘23, we’ve designed a special track for AI and the open web:&nbsp;”AI is NEAR”. Leading the way will be NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin, a pioneer in the world of AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Illia will share his perspective on this past year’s AI revolution, including its intersection with the Web3 space on NEAR in the months to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attention-is-all-you-need">Attention Is All You need</h2>



<p>By now, everyone knows ChatGPT, which kicked off the latest AI revolution. But years before OpenAI released its AI chatbot, a group of researchers published a paper that would revolutionize the fields of AI and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">“Attention is All You Need” paper</a>, of which Illia is a co-author, introduced transformers — the “T” in ChatGPT. Illia’s research was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the major LLMs of today, such as ChatGPT and Bard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At NEARCON ‘23, Illia will draw on his deep expertise in AI to offer a perspective on how AI and Web3 will converge and how blockchains can help AI develop in a more positive direction, mitigating potential risks and introducing more transparency. He will share the strategy for AI on NEAR going forward, including evolving NEAR governance with AI agents and the emergence of new business models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-illia-polosukhin-and-techcrunch-s-mike-butcher-in-a-fireside-chat">Illia Polosukhin and TechCrunch&#8217;s Mike Butcher in a fireside chat</h2>



<p>In this candid discussion, Illia and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch&#8217;s</a> Mike Butcher will explore the evolving role of AI in the open web, what we can expect next, and why the current state of AI controlled by major corporations needs to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the case for open source AI becomes clearer, and as regulators across the globe mitigate risk with new policies, the question now becomes: how can Web3 help AI evolve in a more positive direction?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-join-the-ai-and-open-web-chat-at-nearcon-23">Join the AI and Open Web chat at NEARCON ‘23</h2>



<p>With some of the brightest thought leaders in AI and the open web, NEARCON ‘23 is one not to be missed. Alongside Illia, you will also hear from NEAR co-founder Alex Skidanov, who is currently working on an AI startup that is building smarter large language models, or LLMs, in a more decentralized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will also be a panel discussion on how AI and blockchain technologies will integrate with modern work environments. Niraj Pant, previously an investor at Polychain who is launching a startup at the intersection of AI and Web3, will also deliver a keynote on how AI can be leveraged for decentralized applications and services.</p>

<p><a href="https://cosmose.ai/web3">Cosmose AI</a>, the global platform that uses AI to predict and influence how people shop offline is launching a new piece of technology designed to disrupt the smartphone lock screen experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Called KAIKAINOW, it brings together artificial intelligence and blockchain to help users stay informed and engaged with the world around them without the hassle of unlocking their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW, an opt-in technology, sits on a user&#8217;s home screen. It offers a variety of curated content, including news, language learning, games, and trending stories which would be interspersed between users’ very own personal wallpaper pictures.</p>



<p>“We check our smartphone lock screens on average 80 times a day, always seeing the same&nbsp; wallpaper backdrop. Imagine, instead of seeing the same image over and over again you see it every other time, while enjoying personalized content during remaining interactions,” says Miron Mironiuk, Founder and CEO of Cosmose AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW changes that by harnessing cutting edge AI technology, and pairing it with open web tools found on the NEAR blockchain to ensure the experience is tailored to the user while always adhering to the highest privacy standards.</p>



<p>“The launch of KAIKAINOW by COSMOSE AI shows how far we’ve come in respects to transforming Web3 from an innovative idea to a something that can deliver real world benefits to consumers, while also helping foster brand loyalty and business growth in the retail space,” says Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to align ourselves with such a fantastic, rapidly growing tech firm such as Cosmose AI and look forward to seeing how it will truly transform the world of retail and get the world closer to Web3 mass adoption.”</p>



<p> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blockchain-meets-ai">Blockchain meets AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Publishers and brands provide the content and KAIKAINOW enhances the experience by allowing users to unlock rewards via KAI-CHING, a native token pegged to the US Dollar built on the NEAR Protocol. These tokens can then be used to access exclusive offers only available to KAIKAINOW users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to KAI-CHING, shoppers and retailers benefit from shorter payment processing time and significantly lower fees.</p>



<p>By building both consumer products and its token on NEAR protocol, Cosmose AI is accelerating its Web3 offerings with one of the world’s leading, open source blockchain platforms and further advancing the AI-driven retail ecosystem.</p>



<p>To date, Cosmose AI has served over 20 million stores and reached one billion phones globally. The integration of NEAR technologies means that Cosmose can ensure that users maintain complete control over their data and benefit from the ecosystem they help create. This approach ensures the highest level of privacy for users and aligns with the Company&#8217;s commitment to user safety.</p>



<p>Blockchain’s digital record, paired with NEAR’s open web tooling, means AI services can help improve trust in data integrity and, by extension, in the recommendations that AI provides. Using blockchain to store and distribute AI models provides an audit trail, and pairing blockchain and AI can enhance data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR is helping partners like Cosmose AI harness these tools to create better products that serve customers and partners equally.&nbsp;</p>
