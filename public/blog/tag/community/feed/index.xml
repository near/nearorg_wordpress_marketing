<p>Last week, the Ethereum community gathered in Brussels for EthCC, the largest annual European Ethereum event focused on technology and community. Usually held in Paris, this year&#8217;s event moved to Brussels due to the Summer Olympics. Despite initial mixed reactions to the change in location, the Web3 community descended on the Belgian capital for an intense week of conferences, networking, and learning. The NEAR ecosystem was front and center, touting the same vision it has held since its inception: building a world where all people control their own assets, data, and power of governance.</p>



<p>The week kicked off with NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin delivering a keynote at the Open Source AI Summit titled &#8220;Why the World Needs User-Owned AI.&#8221; Illia presented the case for investing in open-source, User-Owned AI, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in proactively managing risk, improving user safety, and formally verifying code. He stressed that all data used in training AI models must be open-source to ensure transparency, unpack potential biases, and debug issues effectively.</p>



<p>Later in the week, Illia delivered a keynote presentation on the NEAR AI Hub and AI Developer concept. His talk sparked considerable interest, particularly regarding the transformative potential of Developer AI. The audience was captivated by the vision of a system where individuals, regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources, could transform their ideas into fully-fledged, decentralized, and scalable applications simply by interacting with an AI-driven development platform. This lower barrier to entry for app creation promises to accelerate innovation across the blockchain ecosystem and even in Web2.</p>



<p>NEAR&#8217;s presence at EthCC extended beyond AI discussions. Altan Tutar, CEO of Nuffle Labs, showcased Nuffle&#8217;s pioneering work on data availability, demonstrating how NEAR technology is scaling Ethereum L2s. This presentation highlighted NEAR Protocol&#8217;s versatility beyond its L1 capabilities and its potential to defragment Web3.</p>



<p>Alex Shevchenko from Aurora Labs introduced Forwarder, a personal bridge designed for seamless token transfers between centralized exchanges and various chains, addressing the rapid growth of new blockchains in the ecosystem.</p>



<p>A significant highlight of NEAR&#8217;s participation was the Chain Abstraction Day Brussels on July 10th. Co-hosted with Agoric Systems, this event marked the culmination of NEAR&#8217;s year-long series on interoperability and the future of multi-chain apps and transactions. The day-long program covered different methodologies to achieve chain abstraction to intents, data availability, and infrastructure, including a talk from Illia on what&#8217;s next in the NEAR ecosystem&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saCoQE39Cvo">contributions to Chain Abstraction</a>. A special fireside chat between Agoric&#8217;s Dean Tribble and Illia delved into architecting next-gen Web3 apps.</p>



<p>The NEAR AI Tech Showcase on July 11th further demonstrated NEAR&#8217;s commitment to innovation. The event featured live demonstrations of AI-powered blockchain applications, giving attendees hands-on experience with the latest developments from the NEAR ecosystem. Underpinning these developments was the NEAR Horizon AI Incubation Program, a strategic initiative designed to kickstart NEAR&#8217;s AI ecosystem by collaborating with top-tier Web3 x AI projects.</p>



<p>NEAR&#8217;s presence at EthCC 2024 offered the rest of the Web3 ecosystem a tangible vision of a User-Owned AI future with real technologies already taking shape. By championing the transfer of power and ownership to users, NEAR aims to unlock a myriad of benefits: enhanced productivity, improved search results, personalized experiences, and novel economic opportunities, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to privacy and security. The ecosystem&#8217;s overarching goal remained clear: to onboard 1 billion users to a new open internet. NEAR&#8217;s unique position at the intersection of blockchain and AI showcased its readiness to address the growing demand for decentralized artificial intelligence, leveraging Web3&#8217;s inherent strengths to forge a truly user-owned digital landscape. As the event concluded, it was evident that EthCC 2024 marked a defining moment for NEAR Protocol, highlighting its visionary approach, technological prowess, and unwavering commitment to a decentralized, user-centric future.</p>

PlayEmber’s creative gaming studio is fusing AAA quality mobile games on the blockchain, with NEAR providing the backend foundation. Decentralized mobile gaming experiences are now becoming more accessible to a wider audience.</p>



<p>Then there’s <a href="https://cosmose.co/">Cosmose AI&#8217;s</a> KaiKai, a fusion of shopping, retail, and gamification dubbed&#8221;Shoppertainment.&#8221; Built on NEAR’s Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S), <a href="/blog/cosmose-and-near-foundation-set-to-revolutionize-retail-with-web3-and-ai/?_gl=1%2A1yt7etu%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2ANjE0MjI4NTkyLjE2OTcwMzUyNTQ.%2A_ga_9GWCXQJ62J%2AMTY5NzAzNTI1Mi4xLjAuMTY5NzAzNTI1Mi4wLjAuMA..">KaiKai offers a captivating brand discovery</a> avenue, with features like Augmented Reality (AR) product interactions, exclusive product drops, and celebrity live streams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than just a shopping app, KaiKai also uses a native cryptocurrency, Kai-Ching. Shoppers earn rewards with the help of Cosmose&#8217;s AI-powered personalization, all while transacting on the NEAR blockchain. It’s all about enhancing personalization, user empowerment, and engagements in the retail space with a unique, powerful blockchain twist.</p>



<p>And in a fusion of health and blockchain, <a href="https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin’s</a> partnership with NEAR helps people earn SWEAT tokens with literally every step towards better fitness. With a user base of over 63 million who&#8217;ve clocked in more than 19 trillion steps, Sweatcoin and NEAR are incentivizing&nbsp; healthier lifestyles.</p>



<p>Oleg Fomenko, co-founder of Sweatcoin, believes in the <a href="https://near.org/blog/sweatcoin-partners-with-near-foundation-to-create-a-new-movement-economy">potential of merging health and blockchain</a>, enabling users to “walk into the world of crypto.” This partnership, built on the NEAR blockchain, personifies the next level of open web adoption, encouraging physical wellness via crypto-based rewards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-financial-empowerment-and-innovation-on-near">Financial empowerment and innovation on NEAR</h2>

The Foundation’s collaboration with Proximity Labs is helping talented builders create innovative Web3 financial solutions, with substantial grants and support.</p>



<p>Calimero Network is another example of NEAR&#8217;s commitment to financial innovation. Calimero provides what’s called ‘private sharding’ infrastructure, a feature that ensures&nbsp; data privacy in Web3 finance without sacrificing the power of open-source platforms. With both <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/204235/private-sharding-startup-calimero-network-raises-8-5-million">financial and technical support from NEAR</a>, more business can be safely conducted on the blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-technical-foundation-for-tomorrow-s-open-web">Building the technical foundation for tomorrow’s open web</h2>



<p>The ongoing partnership between NEAR Protocol and <a href="https://oct.network/">Octopus Network</a> signifies the ecosystem’s infrastructure strides. Early on, Octopus Network selected NEAR as its “mother-chain” protocol citing speed ability to accommodate a large user base.

<p>Partnering with a tech infrastructure behemoth like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/near-building-useable-web3-infrastructure-on-google-cloud">Google Cloud</a> is another way of giving Web3 startups pathways to world-class startup expertise. It’s all part of NEAR’s commitment to making blockchain solutions more accessible, robust, and primed for mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>, NEAR is also continuing to make the open web more user friendly. Urbit’s vision — shared and supported by the NEAR Foundation — is to improve the frontend experience of open web apps. Urbit allows developers to easily create sleek designs so that tomorrow’s decentralized applications are as seamless as the most popular ones in the App Store.</p>



<p>On another front, NEAR&#8217;s collaboration with <a href="https://sailgp.com/">SailGP</a> is bringing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to professional sports, creating a bridge between leagues and fans. The introduction of a DAO-owned racing team on the NEAR Protocol gives fans a novel way to engage, interact with, and participate in active decision making along with teams and athletes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-partnership-innovation-rolls-on-at-nearcon">Partnership innovation rolls on at NEARCON</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was an incredible first-ever <a href="https://nearapac.org/">NEAR APAC</a>, with the NEAR ecosystem scootering through Saigon over the last two days. Vietnam served as the perfect backdrop for NEAR’s inaugural showcase in Asia-Pacific, with community members, B.O.S. builders, and general Web3 enthusiasts coming together in one of the region&#8217;s most dynamic countries.</p>



<p>The event was spearheaded by the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam Hub</a> with support from the NEAR Foundation, exemplifying strong commitment and collaboration between local and global ecosystem stakeholders.&nbsp; ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<p>ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-s-bright-investment-outlook-in-asia-pacific">Web3’s bright investment outlook in Asia-Pacific</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20876" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the most encouraging and optimistic sessions was moderated by NEAR’s Head of Finance, David Norris, focusing on the current and future outlook of blockchain investment and development in the region. David was joined by Web3 venture veterans Riccardo Pagano from <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a> and Whiplus Wang of <a href="https://www.ivcrypto.io/">IVC crypto</a>.</p>



<p>The trio dove into the current state of blockchain investment in APAC, and how Web3 might just ascend to becoming one of the most invested sectors in the region from a venture and infrastructure perspective. Ricardo in particular emphasized that he’s seeing a shift in perception from investors, with Web3 going from a niche technology to its own broad-based sector.</p>



<p>“Even though we’re technically in a bear market, investment in Web3 sub-sectors like gaming is still strong,” added Whiplus. “Games like<em> Angry Birds </em>and <em>Fruit Ninja</em> were instrumental in onboarding Web2 users onto the smartphone, for example. That’s why investment into blockchain game publishers is increasing — to find that killer game that onboards billions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20874" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Whiplus also likened successful blockchain startups to a bowl of Pho, with a blend of technical and business elements being integral to a delicious final dish. The panel also touched on technical nuances like ZK rollups and modular blockchains, emphasizing the need to invest in talent and innovation through initiatives like hackathons.</p>



<p>The session encapsulated a forward-looking perspective on Web3&#8217;s trajectory. With the bar for founder participation evidently rising, the panel stressed the importance of education in the space. There was unanimous optimism about Southeast Asia&#8217;s digital future as potentially outpacing even established tech hubs like Korea and Japan.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-supports-b-o-s-and-blockchain-builders-in-apac">NEAR supports B.O.S. and blockchain builders in APAC</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20871" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-768x512.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Tons of activity also took place in and around the Builder Stage, with the NEAR Foundation and local blockchain organizations teaming up to educate and assist developers, builders, and job seekers in advancing themselves into Web3. Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, led a panel on the stage informing developers on how to upskill from Web2 to Web3.</p>



<p>Local developer advocates from notable projects like the Graph and Khyber network also participated in sessions, workshops, and panels on the Builder Stage designed to upskill local blockchain professionals. There was something for everyone, from a job fair for Web3 newbies to a Greenhouse area connecting founders and projects to VCs for funding.</p>



<p>Exploring everything from dApp architecture to tokenomics, the Builder Stage action was highlighted by an incredible Hackathon, with participants receiving guidance from experts like Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweateconomy.com/">SWEAT</a>. On the final night of the festivities, NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin presented awards to the winners on stage in front of a packed main hall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pagoda-takes-the-main-stage-to-talk-user-adoption-and-fastauth">Pagoda takes the main stage to talk user adoption and FastAuth</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20873" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-768x512.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, the CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, showcased FastAuth during his session titled &#8220;Unlocking the Power of B.O.S: Product Update for Founders &amp; Developers.&#8221; FastAuth aims to redefine the user experience for developers and founders, addressing the longstanding challenges of both onboarding and retaining new Web3 users.</p>



<p>A primary takeaway was how FastAuth’s next release will minimize gas fees when onboarding, thus removing barriers for end-users. The introduction of multiparty compute (MPC) allows proofs from various organizations to be combined, simplifying processes like email recovery. Chiocchi emphasized the potential for users to migrate effortlessly from Web2 logins, hinting at a seamless integration between the two web generations.</p>



<p>Discussing the nuances of retaining users in Web3, Chiocchi stressed that coin incentives alone aren&#8217;t sufficient. The &#8220;toothbrush test&#8221; was highlighted, illustrating that many apps don&#8217;t become daily necessities for users. Trust plays a pivotal role, especially with the rise of scams in the decentralized space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-side-events-and-after-parties-storm-the-streets-of-saigon">Side events and after-parties storm the streets of Saigon</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20872" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>NEAR APAC fully embraced the “work hard, play hard” ethos of Vietnam and Asia-Pacific. Even during the event, there were LED dancers, Manga Cosplay, and several massive DJs and party breaks. Not to mention the NEAR APAC Opening Night party at the Intercontinental Hotel, where Illia officially welcomed attendees and kicked things off in an intimate setting.</p>



<p>And in one of the coolest side events in recent NEAR memory, Dap Dap showcased its platform to B.O.S. enthusiasts at the My House meeting venue nestled in one of Saigon’s many cozily-lit alleyways. Dap Dap is the first commercial B.O.S. product and will act as a gateway to hundreds of chains and protocols for users from a single, user-friendly interface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20875" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-300x200.jpg 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-768x511.jpg 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>B.O.S Beats by <a href="https://www.daorecords.org/">DAO Records</a> was the grand finale of NEAR APAC, offering a vibrant blend of hip-hop beats from prominent DJs on the decentralized record label. Held at Indika Saigon — and with pizza supplied by Pizza DAO — attendees enjoyed live performances, refreshments, and networking opportunities with the global and APAC NEAR communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR APAC was an incredible Web3 Bánh Mì, layering an eclectic mix of speakers, insights, and events to create something completely unique. The NEAR Foundation would like to thank every cook in the kitchen, especially local partners like the NEAR Vietnam Hub who made sure that the first ever NEAR APAC had the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It would&#8217;ve been hard to imagine topping a jam-packed Day 1 of NEAR APAC, but Day 2 managed to do just that. The gorgeous Sunday in Saigon covered a wide range of topics, including significant discussions on the future trends in Web3 such as how brands can hop on board the Web3 bandwagon and a creative proposal to unite all Layer 1&#8217;s for mass adoption.</p>



<p>With each session, industry leaders shed light on challenges and the future trajectory of the fast-paced Web3 ecosystem in APAC. From the unique positioning of Web3 gaming in Asia to the potential rise of the next Web3 cycle, the discussions were varied and far-reaching. Let&#8217;s dive on into all the Day 2 happenings at NEAR APAC in Vietnam!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-apac-experts-discuss-the-next-big-trends-in-web3">APAC experts discuss the next big trends in Web3</h2>



<p>Let’s begin the Day Two recap with a standout panel diving into the next big Web3 trends. Experts agreed that it won’t just be about technological progress, but also the transformative ways that blockchain will weave into daily life. Asset tokenization, generative AI integration, and the proliferation of decentralized creator economies were some top trends on the table.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RgVgqs1g0x-gnx5Kvaa6mVPfaIXaZxyV1m_WAE0Ce6zUb-OKD6-LI066PiE1II_S3T9bDYSHDGyGVyG5Np03ekD10YSpe6r5bbN36500oObHLrOGuQD3Q2W_po-e_vF-tBOVuvLoBIHvgM0lZiJPI5I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>“Generative AI and asset tokenization are revolutionizing Web3 ecosystems, especially in growing economies like India,” said Sudeep Choudhari, head of blockchain at the <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/">India National Payments Corporation</a>. “As integration across borders accelerates, we’ll also challenge traditional FX rates, anticipating a future with minimal cross-border payment costs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hanna Tantoco, APAC Marketing Director at <a href="https://www.blockdaemon.com/">Blockdaemon</a>, piggybacked on the transformative role of generative AI in enhancing blockchain user experiences. She also pointed out the rising prominence of gaming in Asia, particularly on NEAR. Additionally, she highlighted Singapore&#8217;s burgeoning creator economy, powered largely by NFTs, as another future trend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brands-can-futureproof-themselves-with-blockchain">How brands can futureproof themselves with blockchain</h2>



<p>Another morning highlight was a panel discussion about how brands and enterprises can harness the potential of Web3 to adapt and thrive. Key points revolved around democratizing user data control, countering data monopolization by tech giants, tokenizing assets, and challenges in linking the physical and digital worlds.</p>



<p>“Enterprises often face challenges with hiring experts who may quickly move on to other projects,” observed Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweatco.in/">SWEAT</a>. “While consultancies can provide insights, the real breakthrough comes when you start building and experimenting with MVPs. Though initial attempts might fall short, perseverance can yield surprising results.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sd5LLo5KtoZlpO890p-2gemKPglzS_SZ4oWvR0pbA9WS1QOKwX-KJJCRBvObEAfU2shd5zUxumyCybxoyQT6OLdB_TbzLsOY6X-xrcfjVbRwp3UzXdhEFaVVk1sCFuO3x0PIQJ2xxlqQdk9SjCmrKVw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, added that Web3 streamlines verification, challenging traditional ad networks. By using an open blockchain system, excessive fees are prevented, promoting shared value with users. This shift allows benefits like self-custody and reputation while redistributing margins back to the people.</p>



<p>Among the key takeaways from the session was that businesses harnessing blockchain&#8217;s capabilities can anticipate a transformative impact on the global economy, especially with asset tokenization&#8217;s projected growth through 2030. As brands navigate challenges like ensuring digital authenticity and early adoption, having a targeted strategy is crucial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-gaming-asia-s-landscape-and-blockchain-utilization">Web3 gaming: Asia&#8217;s landscape and blockchain utilization</h2>



<p>The Asian gaming landscape is buzzing with the rise of Web3 development, promising an unprecedented era of innovation and user empowerment. Central to discussions at the &#8220;Web3 Gaming: Asia Landscape&#8221; session was the gaming community&#8217;s appetite for asset and data ownership, often prioritizing this over the complexities of Web3 itself.</p>



<p>After attending Korea Blockchain Week, it&#8217;s evident that Japan and Korea&#8217;s mobile giants are pioneering in Web3 gaming,” said Luke Xie, founder of gaming VC fund <a href="https://pressstart.capital/">Press Start Capital</a>. “As opposed to Web3 games like Axie, creating AAA games takes much longer. Given the rapid pace of crypto, former mobile developers align better with this fast-paced dynamic.”</p>



<p>Ishank Gupta, co-founder of <a href="https://www.kratosstudios.io/">Kratos Studios</a> in India, emphasized that gamers prioritize asset and data ownership over backend Web3 tech. He predicted that blockchain games should bring benefits that gamers care about with a focus on ease of usability. For instance, leading studios in India are integrating well-known IP into Web3 games while ensuring they remain engaging.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re witnessing a new golden age of gaming driven by indie studios,” added Xie. “Small teams, empowered by AI, are crafting games that punch above their weight. We believe that on-chain gaming, while difficult to execute at present, is the future. It’s all about selecting the right chain based on tech, community, and support. NEAR excels at all of the above.”</p>



<p>The panel agreed that the Web3 gaming industry in APAC and beyond is undergoing a transformative phase, with blockchain offering gamers more control over assets and data. As developers continue to build, the focus will be on seamless onboarding, speed, and user-centric experiences. Blockchains should be subtly integrated without disrupting the gaming experience.</p>

<p>Today’s blockchain landscape consists of independent Layer 1’s vying for supremacy, bringing up the core question of interoperability. With users often navigating several ecosystems, creating cross-chain experiences becomes paramount. This star-studded panel explored new frameworks to address hurdles and challenges in the current siloed multi-chain user experience.</p>

<p>“Web3&#8217;s ethos is modularity, similar to Lego blocks,” explained NEAR CEO Marike Flament. “While we prioritize access and user growth, interoperability challenges persist. But trust and unified solutions drive adoption, not a fractured approach. It&#8217;s essential that technology seamlessly serves the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, added that key management is a critical issue. He pointed out ways to simplify these processes with tools like <a href="https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth">FastAuth</a>. Dennis added that addressing the noticeable gap in cross-chain liquidity should be a focus. He believes that a true multichain future that drives adoption will solve key and wallet management for a better UX.</p>



<p>“Reflecting on a decade in this space, the competitive landscape has shifted,” mused Mary Beth Buchanan from the Cardano Foundation who is also an advisor to NEAR, “Earlier, exchanges hesitated to collaborate, fearing a loss of advantage. Today, there&#8217;s a collective push to learn from one another, ensuring technology works seamlessly for the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron believes that reinforcing the current ecosystem is paramount before extending cross-chain efforts, even though creating a decentralized internet remains a resource-intensive endeavor.</p>



<p>Marieke stressed the importance of open-source technology in attracting top talent. Drawing inspiration from Web2&#8217;s approach to 5G standardization, she suggested that Layer 1 leaders could unite in an &#8216;L20&#8217; alliance to champion unified standards, fostering a unified vision for the industry&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>And that’s a wrap for the official Day 2 sessions at NEAR APAC. From gaming and brand adoption to multi-chain standards and collaboration, it was clear that this first-of-its-kind regional event was a rousing success for developers and the NEAR community alike. Sunday in Saigon rolls on with more side events and after-parties, so stay tuned for the full ICYMI tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After many months in the making, the inaugural NEAR APAC conference kicked off today in Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam. Held in conjunction with the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam community</a> and NEAR Foundation, NEAR APAC is showcasing the vibrant crypto and Web3 community across the region as well as the potential of the B.O.S. and Open Web both locally and globally.</p>



<p>The day was charged with excitement, drawing over 8,000 attendees from various corners of the APAC region and beyond. With Web3 thought leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts converging in Vietnam, Day One of NEAR APAC kicked off with a slew of riveting discussions, industry insights, and speculations on the future of the Open Web with a focus on APAC.</p>



<p>From discussions around regional growth and investment potential to how AI and blockchain will transform the future of work, here’s everything that went down at an incredible start to NEAR APAC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-the-stage-for-near-apac-with-vietnam-in-focus">Setting the stage for NEAR APAC with Vietnam in focus</h2>



<p>The event kicked off with a focus on southeast Asia, with NEAR’s Vietnam country director Riley Tran welcoming attendees and providing context as to Asia’s critical role in the overarching development and expansion of Web3. Tran was followed by two NEAR luminaries, CEO Marieke Flament and co-founder Illia Polosukhin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Asia&#8217;s young demographics and rapid digital growth, especially in Vietnam, position it as a leader in crypto and blockchain growth,” Riley explained. “With over 100 million new internet users in just three years, Asia&#8217;s momentum in Web3 is accelerating”</p>



<p>Marieke added that the overall NEAR ecosystem remains strong with over 29M active wallets and 650K daily active accounts. She added that a collaborative approach to building tomorrow’s Open Web is critical for tackling significant societal and digital challenges.<br><br>&#8220;Today’s Web 2.0 is closed and siloed, with the prevailing digital culture being a toxic dialectic,&#8221; Marieke expressed. “But the value loop of an Open Web holds immense promise. We’re already seeing how projects like KaiKai, SWEAT, and PlayEmber can move the needle in the right direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Echoing Mariek’s sentiment, Illia emphasized that it’s not necessarily about championing a specific blockchain, but about creating a common layer and interface for the Open Web. This is precisely what the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) is in the process of achieving.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looking forward, tech isn&#8217;t the only focus,” said Illia. “It&#8217;s about blending scalable solutions with user-centric experiences, with the B.O.S. becoming the essential entry point into Web3 for both users and developers.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asia-s-role-in-mainstream-adoption-and-regulatory-hurdles">Asia’s role in mainstream adoption and regulatory hurdles</h2>



<p>The push for mainstream blockchain adoption in APAC was also in focus on Day One, with NEAR Foundation CMO Jack Collier leading a panel discussion on current adoption challenges and how APAC can potentially lead the way in overcoming them.</p>



<p>“I’m extremely bullish on gaming as a key part of mass adoption,” opined Don Pham, Google Cloud’s regional Web3 specialist. “Vietnam is the birthplace of Axie Infinity, which is just the beginning of blockchain gaming’s potential. Use cases like loyalty, gaming, and music NFTs combined with better UX will likely be the path forward.”</p>



<p>The discussion dove deeper into the importance of user experience in the adoption of blockchain. Marieke reiterated that while technology forms the backbone, the real test will be simplifying the user journey, which can significantly hasten adoption across the APAC region as well as globally.</p>



<p>Regulation was also in focus with a panel about blockchain policies and APAC&#8217;s vision for governments and associations. Mary Beth Buchanan, a board member of the Cardano Foundation, drove home the need for regulatory clarity while discussing regional frameworks in countries like Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“The biggest challenge is not necessarily regulation, but lack of clarity,” observed Buchanan. “If regulations are unclear that will cause investors not to want to invest in the space. Builders become hesitant to build and users aren’t going to know what the rules are. Regulators need to recognize that clarity is what everyone wants.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotlight-on-artificial-intelligence-during-the-afternoon-sessions">Spotlight on Artificial Intelligence during the afternoon sessions</h2>



<p>Day One of NEAR APAC dedicated a significant chunk of its schedule to exploring the intricate interplay between AI and blockchain, particularly their role in APAC’s future technology and Web3 landscape. Illia took the stage just after the lunch break to discuss the Convergence of AI and Web3, diving deep into AI-empowered DAO and the future of AI-assisted work.</p>



<p>“While technologies like ChatGPT have found product market fit, much of AI is still siloed and doesn’t empower open source communities and projects,” Illia posited. “Web3 can operate in the middle, with AI models incorporating all participants and data sources. DAOs, for example, can be co-piloted by AI to achieve goals and KPIs faster and more efficiently.”</p>



<p>In the following panel discussion entitled “The Roles of Blockchains in an AI World,” Illia was joined by several AI and blockchain experts from the APAC region. One of the more distinguished panel members was Dr. Nguyen An Khuong, a lecturer and blockchain researcher from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, who provided an academic perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a lot of research endeavors in Vietnam around ensuring AI&#8217;s ethical applications using blockchain,” commented Dr. Nguyen. “We’re looking at how transparency and accountability in AI decisions can be drastically improved with blockchain technology. Combining a neutral AI with a blockchain’s public ledger could enhance the ecosystem and foster wider adoption.”</p>



<p>Illia drove home that the potential “Skynet” scenario of AI taking over the world is mostly a projection of what humans might do if they were given supercomputing powers. In reality, developments like the B.O.S. and NEAR Tasks will aid humans in success and productivity, with AI agents acting as middlemen for assistance, sourcing, and even creativity.</p>



<p>Day One of the first-ever NEAR APAC was a rousing success, with these highlights just being the tip of the iceberg. The crowd was treated to bánh mì’s and Manga cosplay during lunch, B.O.S. building and gaming workshops on the Builder Stage, and an awe-inspiring NFT gallery from APAC creators.</p>



<p>As the sun sets in Saigon, the NEAR Foundation couldn’t be more appreciative of the Vietnamese crypto community. The momentum rolls on tomorrow with Day Two, so stay tuned for more updates and insights around emerging APAC trends in Web3, how blockchain gaming is taking off in Asia-Pacific, and local DeFi developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Day One was any indication, the NEAR community’s growth, presence, and development in APAC will only continue accelerating through 2023 and beyond!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things the NEAR Foundation has always been most proud of is the passion and enthusiasm of our builders and grassroots projects — something we have seen demonstrated again since the <a href="/blog/an-update-on-the-ndc-funding-and-support-for-grassroots-projects/?_gl=1%2A1nhhje7%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2AMTE0NTY2MjU3OS4xNjkyOTY4MDg2%2A_ga_9GWCXQJ62J%2AMTY5Mjk2ODA4NC4xLjAuMTY5Mjk2ODA4NC4wLjAuMA..">recent post</a> about the NDC. Over the past week alone, over 30 projects have reached out to the Ecosystem Team and a number of conversations are already underway. This has allowed NEAR Foundation to begin mapping out current needs, and understand the best way to provide support that will ensure the NEAR ecosystem remains a vibrant, open, and accessible place to build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us at the Foundation, hearing directly from builders provides invaluable insight into the state of the ecosystem and how we can best continue to support the people and projects that make it what it is. What we have heard so far is that while financial support is important as the NDC fully ramps up, every project has a unique set of needs that requires a holistic approach to provide the right support, and that simply re-starting a grants program is not the right solution. To make sure that we get as many perspectives from across the ecosystem, we will be leaving the form open for one more week (until September 4th) to give anyone who needs support a chance to have their voice heard.</p>



<p>Once the form is closed and we have had a chance to review all of the inputs, we will then begin setting out a broader plan — in alignment with the NDC —&nbsp;to ensure projects get the support they need as we continue moving forward on the path to decentralization. The moment we have the full insights from these conversations, which should be within the next few weeks, we will share them in a follow-up blog post along with a clear plan on how we will be moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are excited to have so much interest from builders, and look forward to creating a plan that can help keep grassroots projects engaged and building.</p>
