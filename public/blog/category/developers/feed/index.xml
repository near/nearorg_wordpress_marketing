										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a major step forward for the NEAR Protocol’s (NEAR) vision of Chain Abstraction—seamless interoperability across all blockchains—Ethereum users are now able to freely interact with NEAR applications using MetaMask, Phantom, or other ETH wallets. This NEAR Wallet Selector integration for Ethereum wallets was built by Aurora Labs.</p>



<p>NEAR will now have direct exposure to the Ethereum community, further reducing the friction of users having to create NEAR wallets before interacting with NEAR/multichain apps. All Ethereum users—and this is particularly relevant to DeFi users—now have access to the benefits of Chain Signatures and Chain Abstraction apps, with no new wallets or assets needed. Developers and teams can directly embed the Ethereum wallet selector in their apps, allowing users to sign in using MetaMask or the ETH wallet of their choice.</p>



<p>NEAR co-founder and CEO Illia Polosukhin comments: “Enabling all Ethereum wallets, including MetaMask, to sign in on NEAR apps closes another gap in achieving Chain Abstraction. ETH users are now able to explore experiences on NEAR and other chains without needing to switch wallets. This is a big step forward for simpler onboarding and defragmenting liquidity and access for DeFi users, bringing all of Web3 closer to achieving the Chain Abstraction vision.”</p>



<p>Aurora Labs is the project behind Aurora, a network of Virtual Chains that combines NEAR’s scalability with powerful infrastructure for the easy deployment of preconfigured blockchains.</p>



<p>“By integrating Ethereum wallets into NEAR’s ecosystem,” said Aurora Labs’ CEO Alex Shevchenko, “we streamline access and enhance the developer experience. Developers can now build apps that seamlessly serve both NEAR and Ethereum users, simplifying onboarding and expanding liquidity channels. This is a crucial step toward a unified Web3 where users and capital move freely across ecosystems.”</p>



<p>A short list of NEAR partners implementing the Ethereum wallet integration includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://testnet.thunderhood.com/home">Thunderhood</a></li>



<li><a href="https://burrow.finance/">Burrow.finance</a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Currently the Web3 DeFi experience is complex and siloed in different chains, with fragmented liquidity. Instead of transacting directly on every chain, a new approach called “Intents” has been introduced to allow users to express what they want to happen and let other on-chain participants figure out how to execute it. But despite becoming a Web3 buzzword in 2024, so far every example of intents has been limited to very primitive cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the rise of AI agents across the entire Web has created a need for their interoperability. Agents need a negotiation and commitment framework that allows them to work together across a variety of systems under the hood. While some may see on-chain DeFi participants and AI agents as completely separate today, the NEAR ecosystem envisions an AI-first economy where AI agents and solvers are both responsible for executing intents and fulfilling the transaction commitment to users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are excited to introduce NEAR Intents as part of the core NEAR Protocol. NEAR Intents are a new type of transaction that allows multiple actors to commit to certain changes of their state. This allows the exchange of information, assets, physical goods, and services between AI agents, services, and end users. Intents represent a novel transaction framework for both Web2 and Web3, allowing the execution of off-chain actions and multichain transactions with unparalleled speed, security, ease of use, and reliability.</p>



<p>As the blockchain for AI, NEAR Protocol is launching NEAR Intents to unlock a new era of interactions between AI and the real world, making AI agents and on-chain liquidity readily available to everyone. NEAR Intents are starting in beta today on <a href="http://near.org/intents">near.org/intents</a> and will fully launch in Q1 2025.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Defuse" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJeWZO3NIwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><br></p>



<p>Leveraging NEAR Protocol’s chain abstraction stack and the intent solver network, NEAR Intents allow trading of any asset on any chain from a single account or by any agent, without the need for bridging or wrapping assets. Both AI agents and end users can take action with NEAR Intents across Web2 and Web3, unlocking a massive range of new functionalities and use cases with better usability than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to unifying liquidity across all chains, NEAR Intents enable use cases above and beyond simple swaps, including on-chain functions natively for stablecoins across any chains, DeFi programmability for non-smart contract assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, collateralizing existing derivatives positions to borrow stablecoins on another chain, or even swapping/selling entire accounts. When you combine any intent type with the power of AI agents, net-new primitives like inter-agent trading, communication, and much more become possible, creating even more new and innovative DeFi opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key features of NEAR Intents include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Decentralized Finance Infrastructure: NEAR Intents enable decentralized, cross-chain DeFi infrastructure for trading of various financial instruments. Designed to be open and permissionless, any developer can launch their own financial products.</li>



<li>Multichain Abstraction: Leveraging NEAR Protocol’s chain abstraction technology, NEAR Intents seamlessly integrate multiple blockchain networks without relying on traditional bridges, reducing associated risks and costs, as well as wait times. This ensures that any app can add instant support for new networks and tokens.</li>



<li>Intent-Based Architecture: Instead of a traditional AMM architecture that requires on-chain pools, NEAR Intents operate on an intent-based model with requests for quotes fulfilled by solvers. This allows for better liquidity access (DeFi, CeFi, and off-chain), resulting in better prices.</li>



<li>AccountFi: Leveraging the concept of AccountFi where financial operations are conducted upon accounts rather than individual tokens, NEAR Intents allow for the trading, lending, and management of accounts possessing different assets, such as fungible tokens, NFTs, and non-transferable tokens like Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).</li>
</ul>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem believes that the next wave of DeFi will power the future AI economy. NEAR Intents are a major step towards realizing this vision, opening up amazing new use cases for DeFi and unlocking the true power of Chain Abstracted blockchain and AI combined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The launch of stateless validation in August 2024 marks an important milestone for NEAR Protocol, but it is by no means the end state of the protocol. There is still a lot of ambitious work to be done. </p>



<p>In less than four years since launching mainnet, the NEAR network has over 110 million users – a great achievement for the ecosystem. But the goal for NEAR is to onboard a billion people to the User-Owned Internet. Achieving such widespread usage will require an even more scalable, performant, secure, and fast protocol. The Near One team is already working to make improvements to Nightshade 2.0 and has started planning the next round of advancements. In this post, we describe what the protocol roadmap looks like for the rest of 2024 and into next year.</p>



<p>First of all, while the stateless validation launch is a major change to the protocol, it does not immediately improve the performance of mainnet. This is because we intentionally keep the upgrade as simple as possible to avoid adding more complexity into the already humongous upgrade. To fully reap the benefits of the new design, there are a number of improvements on top of the release that we will work on for the rest of 2024 following the August launch:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Optimization of state witness size.</strong> In the current implementation, state witness size could be quite large, primarily due to the size of contract code included in a state witness. Optimization of state witness size will reduce the likelihood of a chunk hitting the size limit, thereby improving transaction throughput.</li>



<li><strong>Reduce gas cost for storage operations.</strong> One of the key benefits of stateless validation is that state accesses (reads and writes) are now fully in memory. It means that the gas cost of state accesses could be significantly reduced, which allows for higher transaction throughput.</li>



<li><strong>Resharding.</strong> The launch of stateless validation means that no validator node needs to track all shards, which enables scaling to potentially many more shards. However, due to the architectural change, the old method of resharding no longer works and a new method needs to be developed and tested. The new method of resharding will be quite fast and will lay the groundwork for dynamic resharding (see more about this development below).</li>



<li><strong>Node synchronization.</strong> While not strictly related to stateless validation, the synchronization time for a mainnet node has been a pain point for many node operators. Work will be done in this area both to improve the speed of synchronization and ensure that the synchronization process does not depend on centralized services.</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the immediate priorities listed above, there are some long-term improvements that we intend to work on starting in early 2025:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Transaction priority fee.</strong> In the stateless validation launch, we introduced congestion control that provides better latency for accepted transactions under congestion conditions. However, users may want to pay more to get to the front of the queue for certain use cases such as trading or arbitrage. Establishing a transaction priority fee mechanism will make NEAR easier to use when there is short-term congestion.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic resharding.</strong> The holy grail of sharding: the network dynamically adjusts the number of shards based on the load. When a shard is overloaded, it splits itself into two shards. Similarly, when two shards are both underutilized, they get merged back into one shard for the sake of efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Runtime performance improvements.</strong> There are a number of ideas that we’d like to experiment with to improve runtime performance of NEAR, which includes pipelining contract execution, parallel execution of transactions and receipts, and using an optimizing compiler for wasm.</li>



<li><strong>Leaderless consensus.</strong> The current consensus mechanism degrades in performance when some nodes are offline, which could happen during a protocol upgrade. A leaderless consensus is much less sensitive to a small number of nodes being offline and can also provide higher throughput.</li>



<li><strong>Sharded smart contracts.</strong> Today each smart contract resides on a specific shard. While the more shards there are on mainnet, the better the overall throughput will be, a smart contract per se cannot take full advantage of NEAR’s sharding. Allowing a smart contract to be sharded (exist on all shards simultaneously) could unlock use cases that are not possible today and make it possible to build dapps with hundreds of millions of users on NEAR.</li>
</ul>



<p>These initiatives will significantly improve the performance and scalability of NEAR and make it possible to support hundreds of millions, even a billion daily transactions. The new level of scalability lays a solid foundation for the different verticals of initiatives in the NEAR ecosystem, such as Chain Abstraction, Modularity, and User-Owned AI. Stay tuned for more on performance and efficiency improvements in the coming months and a more detailed future roadmap update towards the end of the year.<br></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TLDR:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Introduces stateless validation</strong>: an innovative approach to validating state transition, or the process of updating the status of all the data posted to the blockchain. Now, NEAR validators no longer have to maintain the state of a shard locally.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability, usability improvements: </strong>Nightshade 2.0 Improves single-shard performance significantly and adds capacity for more shards: NEAR currently has 6 shards and the plan is to have 10 shards by the end of 2024.</li>



<li><strong>Advancing towards NEAR vision:</strong> Upgrades NEAR’s already high-performance and scalable infrastructure to support the growing number of users and activities in the NEAR ecosystem, including consumer apps, Chain Abstraction, modularity, DeFi, and User-Owned AI, to a billion users and beyond. NEAR saw over 20 million monthly active users in July 2024, with over 110 million accounts overall. </li>
</ul>



<p>Nightshade 2.0, the latest advancement in the NEAR Protocol sharding roadmap, is now live on Mainnet. This upgrade introduces stateless validation and improves the scalability, performance, and decentralization of the protocol. Nightshade 2.0 is a major milestone for the NEAR network, marking the biggest change to the protocol since mainnet launched in October 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introducing Stateless Validation</h4>



<p>Introducing stateless validation to the sharding architecture of NEAR Protocol both improves single-shard performance as well as adds capacity for more shards on the network. The upgrade happens live, without affecting mainnet users and applications. Currently at six shards, NEAR aims to have ten shards by the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stateless validation is an innovative approach to validating state transition, or the process of updating the status of all the data posted to the blockchain. Sharding is NEAR’s unique approach to scaling, which partitions the blockchain into multiple parallel “shards.” With Nightshade sharding, both the state and processing are divided among shards. Now, NEAR validators no longer have to maintain the state of a shard locally and can retrieve all the information they need to validate state changes, or “state witness,” from the network. Stateless validation was originally proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2017 and NEAR is one of the only blockchain networks to implement the approach.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking Even Higher Performance &amp; Scalability</h4>



<p>In Nightshade 2.0, validators no longer need to track all shards and there are lower hardware requirements and costs for running a validator, potentially allowing more validators to join the ecosystem—which will further decentralize the network and enhance its security over time. </p>



<p>“Nightshade 2.0 is a fundamental reworking of NEAR sharding and is a major milestone in NEAR’s development roadmap that will greatly increase NEAR’s efficiency and scalability,” said Bowen Wang, Head of Protocol at <a href="https://nearone.org/">NEAR One</a>. “In particular, the new sharding implementation paves the way to significantly increase NEAR’s already-fast transaction throughput. It also substantially lowers the cost of operating validators, lowering the barrier to entry for&nbsp; more people to become validators, which will improve the decentralization of the network. These performance and scalability upgrades will ensure that NEAR remains fast, cost-effective, and efficient even with millions more users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nightshade 2.0 solves the fundamental bottleneck issue on most L1s of how to scale while preserving both usability and security,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol and CEO of the NEAR Foundation. “By improving the performance of each shard and adding more shards, while also further decentralizing the network, NEAR sets yet another new technical standard with this upgrade. With Nightshade 2.0, NEAR sharding now enables the network to support hundreds of millions of users with high performance and speeds across consumer apps, modularity, Chain Abstraction, DeFi, and User-Owned AI.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Next for NEAR Sharding?</h4>



<p>How does Nightshade 2.0 fit into the long-term sharding roadmap for the NEAR Protocol? Nightshade 2.0 is a shift in direction from the original Nightshade sharding architecture NEAR launched with in 2020, bypassing some fundamental roadblocks in that protocol design around the implementation of challenges in the initial idea of Phase 2, while also unlocking additional benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From here, the focus for the remainder of 2024 will be on making further performance improvements and optimizations on top of those unlocked by Nightshade 2.0. These include introducing a new method of resharding, reducing gas costs for storage operations, and optimization of state witness size. Starting in early 2025, planning for the next phase of NEAR scalability and sharding will begin, including on dynamic re-sharding, the holy grail of sharding, where the network dynamically adjusts the number of shards based on the load. The Near One team will share a more detailed roadmap update in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today marks the official Mainnet release of Chain Signatures, a groundbreaking Chain Abstraction solution built on NEAR. With the testnet phase and security audit now complete, developers can fully leverage Chain Signatures’ unique omnichain capabilities for their dApps on Mainnet. Degens and end users can now enjoy a fully chain abstracted user experience (UX) on the first cohort of Chain Signatures products already live on mainnet.</p>



<p>Chain Signatures utilizes a decentralized multi-party computation (MPC) network enabling NEAR accounts to sign transactions on any blockchain protocol. Chain Signatures are the only MPC solution where smart contracts can sign transactions on any chain and for any number of accounts. This is because accounts are smart contracts by default in the unique NEAR account model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chain Signatures reduce the work of multichain dApp development to a single layer: a smart contract on NEAR that can talk to all other chains. In this way, Chain Signatures abstract away the complexity and hassle of multichain dApps, for developers and users alike, and open up an entirely new design space of applications and user interfaces for Web3. Additionally, while existing bridges or cross-chain messaging protocols cannot support all chains or scale at speed, Chain Signatures can support every blockchain without native integration, whether Ethereum, Bitcoin, the Cosmos ecosystem, or (soon) Solana.</p>



<p>Five applications with more than 6 million active users between them are already using Chain Signatures Mainnet as of launch, with more than fifteen projects actively building. Soon there will be a full ecosystem of Chain Signatures products across this new design space, ranging across wallets, DEXs, lending, trading bots, bridges, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://sweateconomy.com/">Sweat Wallet</a>: 2.5 million active Sweat Wallet users (on NEAR) can bridge assets to and from any chain, starting with BNB and Base, while paying for gas in $SWEAT.</li>



<li><a href="https://allstake.org/">Allstake</a>: Allstake is now live at Phase 0 with mainnet launch on NEAR, Solana, and Ethereum, supporting top LST and LRT protocols such as LiNEAR Protocol, MetaPool, Marinade, Jito, Renzo, and EtherFi.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.herewallet.app/">HERE Wallet</a>: Mobile, Web, and Telegram wallet supporting transactions on any chain. Check out this Hot Protocol (by Here Wallet) <a href="https://youtu.be/8fkgr7avNZA">demo</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://wallet.bitte.ai/">Bitte Wallet</a>: Passkey wallets for any chain, including Bitcoin. Connect to all Ethereum apps with Bitte Wallet using WalletConnect. Watch a demo of how Bitte Wallet is using Chain Signatures <a href="https://youtu.be/0IoMCmvcjNY?si=0NJtvYGem_1iEyiL">here</a>.</li>



<li><a href="http://defuse.org/">Defuse</a>: Truly multichain spot DEX. Trade between any assets on any chain in seconds. See how NEAR Chain Signatures are transforming DeFi in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xERiqWPD6Gk&amp;feature=youtu.be">demo</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Kendall Cole of <a href="http://proximity.dev/">Proximity Labs</a> – a contributor to Chain Signatures – said, &#8220;Chain Signatures is pivotal to replacing the fragmented Web3 landscape with a single user and developer layer that addresses current interoperability challenges. This innovation simplifies the user experience, enables DeFi for blockchains like Bitcoin that do not traditionally support smart contracts, and empowers developers to support all chains seamlessly. By eliminating the need for bridges, Chain Signatures can significantly expand the liquidity and utility of assets across various blockchains. We&#8217;re excited to see Chain Abstraction in the wild, transforming how users and developers interact with decentralized finance and making it more accessible.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another key layer of the Chain Signatures stack is the Multichain Gas Relayer. Instead of forcing users to acquire a separate gas token every time they transact on a new chain, the Multichain Gas Relayer performs the gas payment on the destination chain, on the user’s behalf. The user only needs to pay the equivalent amount in an asset they already hold, whether that’s NEAR or other NEAR-native fungible tokens (such as USDC or USDT). The power of Chain Signatures, together with the gas abstraction of the Multichain Gas Relayer, offers a streamlined user experience as exemplified by top dApps like Sweat Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of Near Protocol and CEO of NEAR Foundation, added, &#8220;Chain Signatures is a game-changing innovation that brings Chain Abstraction to life. Whereas before we had fragmented liquidity in DeFi, now there will be a single DeFi layer for all chains. There is no more need for dozens of wallets and addresses, manual bridging, and paying gas fees in every token. Instead, all of DeFi is accessible from wherever users already are. It’s all possible because smart contracts can now sign transactions for any blockchain, even Bitcoin. This opens up a whole new design space for financial apps in Web3, benefitting degens and also paving the way for new user bases.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of mainnet launch, Chain Signatures’ MPC network is secured by eight reputable validators: <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, <a href="https://www.luganodes.com/">Luganodes</a>, <a href="https://liftedinit.org/">The Lifted Initiative</a>, <a href="https://infstones.com/">InfStones</a>, <a href="https://www.staking4all.org/">Staking4All</a>, <a href="https://node.monster/">Node.Monster,</a> <a href="https://blacksand.xyz/">Black Sand Technologies</a>, and <a href="https://aurora.dev/">Aurora</a>. The initial audit for the Chain Signatures protocol has been conducted by <a href="https://kudelskisecurity.com/">Kudelski</a>, the final report of which will be published soon on the Chain Signatures GitHub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Chain Signatures development roadmap includes adding EDDSA support before the end of the year, increasing throughput, and increasing the number of nodes. As of mainnet launch, Chain Signatures supports all blockchain protocols based on the ECDSA elliptic curve, which includes most chains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and recently, NEAR. With the additional support for the EDDSA elliptic curve (e.g. Solana, TON), Chain Signatures will be able to sign transactions on every known blockchain by Q4 2024. By the end of the year, Chain Signatures will aim to increase throughput up to 300 transactions/second to match NEAR’s sharded capacity. Finally, the number of validators on the network will gradually increase over time with the aim of achieving 40+ highly independent nodes, which would require 27 for a single signature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Chain Signatures?</h2>



<p>Chain Signatures is a groundbreaking technology built on NEAR that enables NEAR accounts, including smart contracts, to sign and execute transactions across multiple blockchains. This innovation leverages Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and a distributed network of node operators to create joint signatures from arbitrary payloads, allowing NEAR users to control external blockchain accounts. This technology enhances blockchain interoperability, giving ownership of diverse assets, cross-chain accounts, and data to a single NEAR account.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>Chain Signatures operates through a series of steps to enable seamless cross-chain transactions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deriving Foreign Addresses:</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chain Signatures uses derivation paths to represent accounts on foreign blockchains.</li>



<li>The NEAR account’s name and the derivation path are used to mathematically <a href="https://docs.near.org/concepts/abstraction/chain-signatures#derivation-paths-one-account-multiple-chains">derive a unique address</a> for the user on the foreign blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Creating the Transaction:</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The client constructs the hash of the transaction to be signed, which varies by the target blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Requesting the Signature:</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A NEAR account or smart contract calls the sign method of the MPC smart contract (<a href="https://nearblocks.io/address/v1.signer">v1.signer</a>) to sign a payload.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Relaying the Signature:</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The client reconstructs the valid transaction using the signature and broadcasts it to the destination blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This process eliminates the need for traditional bridges and enables developers to build innovative cross-chain DeFi applications with seamless user experiences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use Cases</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>DeFi on Bitcoin (and other chain without smart contracts)</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chain signatures allow NEAR smart contract to program assets on Bitcoin.</li>



<li>Build lending, swaps, runes launchpads, passkey-based Bitcoin wallets, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chain agnostic applications</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Since chain signatures can sign transactions for all blockchains, developers can support every single chain with just one smart contract.</li>



<li>Multichain DEXs, lending protocols, oracles, derivatives, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Multichain account abstraction </strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Users can control assets on all chains with just their NEAR account, and can utilize account abstraction features on any chain including passkeys, key rotation, etc.</li>



<li>Using the multichain gas relayer, users can pay for gas fees on any chain using USDC.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Privacy</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chain signatures can be used to encrypt and decrypt information in a programmatic way.</li>



<li>This enables privacy applications, and even decrypting information based on ownership of assets/NFTs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>[REDACTED] is a whole IRL movement: 1,500+ devs, builders, founders, funders, researchers, regulators, and more gathering in person, November 9-11, at the Avani+ Riverside Hotel Bangkok.</p>



<p>Some things can only happen IRL, and some are just way better. Like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gaining insights from the teams defining the intersection of AI and Web3</li>



<li>Upskilling and learning how to develop AI x Web3 products and apps</li>



<li>Forming deep connections to build the user-owned future together</li>
</ul>



<p>[REDACTED] will feature a wide range of curated sessions, workshops, and discussions led by the people driving AI x Web3 and Chain Abstraction. We can finally share that this includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Illia Polosukhin (NEAR)</li>



<li>Curtis Spencer (Electric Capital)</li>



<li>Anand Iyer (Canonical)</li>



<li>Maartje Bus (Messari)</li>



<li>Matt Stephenson (Pantera)</li>



<li>Calanthia Mei (Masa)</li>



<li>Evrard-Nil Daillet (Google)</li>
</ul>



<p>And more to come as we get closer to Bangkok.</p>



<p>Tickets to the [REDACTED] IRL movement are totally free—you just have to <a href="https://redactedbangkok.ai/">apply</a> to attend, either as a participant or as a hacker (about which, see below). Visa letters are available to support visa applications.</p>



<p>For the absolute latest on the movement, <a href="https://t.me/redactedbangkok">join the official [REDACTED] Telegram channel</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">[REDACTED] Hackathon Registration Is Live</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Registration for the [REDACTED] hackathon is <a href="https://redacted.devpost.com/">OPEN</a>.</p>



<p>The [REDACTED] hackathon sets top problem-solvers to collaborating on the biggest issues in AI x Web3 and Chain Abstraction. Kicking off September 5, it’s eight weeks remote so teams can go deep, and it culminates at the IRL movement in Bangkok, November 9-11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hackers accepted into the hackathon can expect workshops and tutorials on industry-leading tools, interactive discussion and support from category/ecosystem experts, and, oh yeah, a chance at over $500k+ in bounties and prizes.</p>



<p>There will also be travel scholarships so qualifying hackers can be IRL in Bangkok for the awards ceremony—and to participate in the IRL movement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get Involved with [REDACTED]</h2>



<p>There are a lot of ways [for partners?] to get involved with [REDACTED], from digital marketing exposure and exclusive access to side events to major visibility at the IRL movement. <a href="https://airtable.com/appdLXQkwmt4rqtW0/pag8inbcwhbrWjXW9/form">Find what’s right for you.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the recently announced <a href="/blog/near-protocol-partners-with-d3-to-apply-for-near-top-level-domain/">partnership between NEAR Foundation and&nbsp;D3</a>, we’re excited to introduce *NEAR Name Tokens; a multichain, cross-platform digital identity for web3 and beyond.</p>



<p>NEAR Foundation is working with D3 to bridge the gap between traditional internet infrastructure and web3. *NEAR Name Tokens are an important step in developing the <a href="https://d3.inc/blog/educational/futureproof-your-digital-identity-how-d3-aims-to-revolutionize-your-online-persona/">futureproof, interoperable digital identities</a> that will be key to driving implementation of chain abstraction, and of developing web3 more broadly.</p>



<p><strong>Complementing the NEAR Ecosystem with *NEAR Name Tokens</strong></p>



<p>NEAR already offers a deeply integrated identity solution with named NEAR accounts. These NEAR accounts, however, are limited to use across the NEAR ecosystem.</p>



<p>*NEAR Name Tokens will offer users a comprehensive digital identity solution across the wider web3 ecosystem, while keeping NEAR front and center.</p>



<p>Users will be able to use these name tokens in a variety of ways, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>As a simplified wallet address across hundreds of different blockchain networks</li>



<li>As an infrastructure identifier across hundreds of different blockchain networks</li>



<li>As a cross-platform username across various different decentralized platforms, including DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi, SportFi and other related applications</li>



<li>As Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to platforms and services that you interact with</li>



<li>To gain access to unique benefits and rewards programs for participating in the D3 ecosystem</li>



<li>As expressions of interest for the eventual .NEAR equivalent domain on the internet</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why *NEAR Instead of .NEAR</strong></p>



<p>*NEAR Name Tokens feature a star, or asterisk (*), between the name and extension—such as <em>you*near</em>—instead of a period (.). In part, this is because NEAR accounts already use a .NEAR extension, and we want to avoid confusion for users.</p>



<p>More importantly, however, we use *NEAR because Name Tokens are unique web3 identifiers, not real domains, and we want to avoid any confusion between these as well. For years, several naming systems across web3 have thrown around the word “domain” quite liberally, without offering any of the actual utility offered by real domains.</p>



<p>Real domains are fully integrated with the Domain Name System, the distributed service that allows users to access websites and email infrastructure with ease. Billions of internet-capable devices—such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, Internet of Things devices, and more—support the DNS and real domains without the need for specialized software or plugins.</p>



<p>Integrating web3 with DNS will be critical in bringing interoperable digital identities to web3. To that end, NEAR Foundation has partnered with D3 to apply for and obtain the .near top-level domain—like the “.org” in <em>near.org</em>—during the upcoming application period for new TLDs, the first in over a decade.</p>



<p><strong>Exclusive Early Access Period to *NEAR Name Tokens for NEAR Account Holders</strong></p>



<p>As part of our initial launch phase later this summer,, existing NEAR account holders will receive exclusive early access to their equivalent *NEAR Name Tokens. For instance, if you already have the <em>name.near</em> NEAR account registered prior to launch, you will receive exclusive access to register <em>name*near</em> for a period of 90 days before names are released for public availability.</p>



<p>Similarly, should a NEAR account be available for any new *NEAR Name Token registrations, D3 will claim it on behalf of users to ensure a uniform experience across the NEAR ecosystem. Users can <a href="https://d3.app/near">sign up for early access</a>, and you’ll be  notified you prior to the official launch of *NEAR Name Tokens later this summer</p>
