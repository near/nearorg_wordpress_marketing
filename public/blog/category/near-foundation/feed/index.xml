<p>The NEAR Foundation is excited to announce the inaugural accelerator focused on Chain Abstraction. This kickoff cohort includes a select group of teams building new DeFi primitives and cross-chain capabilities using NEAR’s Chain Signatures and other components of its chain abstraction stack—and demonstrating the power of cross-chain interoperability and native asset composability&nbsp; to drive user engagement and use cases.</p>



<p>The Web3 space today suffers from chronic fragmentation of liquidity and attention, but thanks to NEAR account aggregation and a scalable, fully sharded blockchain, developers can now unify liquidity and assets across chains. NEAR Chain Signatures enables novel primitives that also serve DeFi use cases across chains. Users can control accounts on other blockchains with their NEAR account, without having to wrap or bridge assets, unlocking true asset composability. NEAR is also the natural home for scalable on-chain AI use cases and powering the future AI economy with the next wave of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This accelerator aims to bring together top NEAR-native DeFi teams and support them to develop diverse, novel use cases and create new opportunities for degens from any native chain.</p>



<p>The cohort teams are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://atlasprotocol.com/"><strong>Atlas Protocol</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Bitcoin liquid staking</li>



<li><a href="https://omnilane.xyz/"><strong>Omnilane</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Cross-chain RFQ (request-for-quote) protocol</li>



<li><a href="https://covenant.finance/"><strong>Covenant Finance</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Perpetual debt and fixed income products</li>



<li><a href="https://www.templarprotocol.com/"><strong>Templar Protocol</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Zero-interest money market</li>



<li><strong>Vita Finance: </strong>Automated market maker<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kairo Money: </strong>Lending protocol</li>



<li><a href="https://testnet.thunderhood.com/home"><strong>Thunderhood:</strong></a> Leverage trading for memecoins</li>



<li><a href="https://www.deltatrade.ai/"><strong>Delta Trade</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Grid trading bot on Telegram</li>



<li><a href="https://allstake.org/"><strong>Allstake</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Multi-asset re-staking</li>
</ul>



<p>The HZN team is  also proud to have the partnership of supporting teams in the NEAR ecosystem to provide distribution and bootstrap liquidity on the primitives developed by the cohort. Those teams include <a href="https://www.ref.finance/"><strong>Ref Finance</strong></a>, <a href="https://burrow.finance/"><strong>Burrow Cash</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.herewallet.app/"><strong>HOT</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.dapdap.net/"><strong>DapDap</strong></a>, and more.</p>



<p>NEAR’s chain abstraction accelerator builds on this year’s successful <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-foundation-launches-ai-incubation-program">NEAR Horizon AI</a> Incubator and <a href="https://near.org/blog/delphi-labs-ai-accelerator">NEAR x Delphi Labs AI Accelerator</a> cohorts. As with the other cohorts, part of the goal for the accelerator is for teams to work together on building and problem-solving; for the Chain Abstraction cohort, this will involve creating experiences that span multiple teams’ apps and protocols–which means net-new opportunities to attract DeFi users and enthusiasts to NEAR.</p>



<p>Participating founders receive dedicated mentorship from notable founders and investors in the space, and seed round preparation, as well as high-quality collaborator referrals and collaboration on go-to-market, incentive programs, and use cases through a multi-month engagement. The inaugural cohort officially launches today, and officially wraps at the end of December, with dedicated support for each team through 2025.</p>



<p>Some members of the cohort will present a first look at their work November 9-11 at NEAR Foundation’s <a href="https://redactedbangkok.ai/">[REDACTED]</a> event in Bangkok, Thailand, a major convening of the visionaries, builders, and developers shaping chain abstraction and user-owned AI on NEAR.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation announces the launch of Nuffle Labs, a new venture spinning out from Pagoda and the NEAR Foundation. Founded by the core contributors to the NEAR Data Availability Layer (NEAR DA) and the NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL), the NEAR Modular product suite is now spinning out into an independent entity dedicated to improving and amplifying NEAR’s modularity offerings. The new entity has secured $13 million in funding, including a strategic grant from NEAR Foundation and external investment led by Electric Capital.</p>



<p>The spinout of Nuffle Labs reflects not only the strength of the core team and the products they are building, but also illustrates the Foundation’s commitment to decentralization by turning core functions over to proven teams in the ecosystem. As an independent team, Nuffle Labs will be better positioned to operate at the forefront of modular blockchain design, nurture its own decentralized community, and forge more partnerships across the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nuffle Labs will leverage NEAR Protocol’s cost-effective, fast, and proven technology to offer rollups enhanced modularity. It is responsible for two key products in NEAR’s modular suite: NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) and NEAR Fast Finality Layer, now Nuffle Fast Finality Layer (NFFL).</p>



<p><strong>Nuffle Labs secures $13M in funding to support their growth</strong></p>



<p>Nuffle Labs’ spinout comes with substantial investment, including a strategic grant from the NEAR Foundation as well as funding from external investors including Electric Capital, Canonical Crypto, Fabric Ventures, Robot Ventures, Caladan, and Lyrik Ventures. Notable angel investors include Jordi Alexander (Selini), Blackdragon VC, Bowen Wang (NEAR), Sreeram Kannan (EigenLayer), Sam Kazemian (Frax), Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), DeFi Dad (4RC), Dovey Wan (Primitive Ventures), and Mert Mumtaz (Helius). With these resources and supporters, the team is well-equipped to advance NEAR DA and NFFL, expand the team, invest in R&amp;D, and build a strong community that spans across NEAR, Ethereum, and beyond.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re proud to support the growth of Nuffle Labs as an independent company in the NEAR ecosystem. These 4 excellent co-founders have built first-rate modularity products that showcase the best of NEAR&#8217;s technology with NEAR DA and NFFL, providing cost-effective and performant solutions to projects across Web3,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol and CEO of NEAR Foundation. “We look forward to continued collaboration with the NEAR Foundation as they expand and evolve.”</p>



<p>Avichal Garg, General Partner at lead investor Electric Capital, said, “We are excited to back Nuffle Labs, the builders behind NEAR DA and the NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL). As the core team that developed these products from the ground up, Nuffle Labs has the expertise to advance these modular solutions, creating a world where intra- and interchain transactions are cheap, fast, and secure.”</p>



<p>“I have had the great privilege of getting to know the founders of Nuffle and working with them from day zero,” said Anand Iyer, General Partner at Canonical Crypto. “Their passion for solving blockchain scaling combined with their expertise from building solutions at NEAR has me genuinely excited for them and their future.”</p>



<p><strong>Understanding NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA)</strong></p>



<p>NEAR DA utilizes the sharded architecture of NEAR Protocol to provide a modular data availability layer for Ethereum rollups with extremely high throughput and low cost. On mainnet launch, RSS3 – an open information protocol bridging AI and Web3 – experienced a substantial cost reduction, paying a daily average of $10 compared to their previous $1,000. NEAR DA currently has a throughput of 24MB/s, significantly higher than its closest competitor’s 6.67MB/s – making NEAR DA the most scalable, cheapest, and reliable DA solution on the market.</p>



<p>NEAR DA’s scalability is further enhanced by its ability to support multiple rollups, whether they are optimistic or ZK-rollups. NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) provides:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cost-efficiency: Storing data on NEAR Protocol is significantly cheaper than on Ethereum, making it easier for projects to build as well as faster.</li>



<li>Effortless Validation: NEAR Protocol&#8217;s trustless off-chain light client simplifies validation, ensuring accurate and reliable transactions.</li>



<li>User-Friendly Interaction: NEAR Protocol provides easy access to on-chain data through RPC, making blockchain interaction seamless for developers and users.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exploring NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL)</strong></p>



<p>The name Nuffle Labs is derived from the acronym NFFL. The Nuffle Fast Finality Layer (NFFL) is an EigenLayer Actively Validated Service (AVS) designed to aggregate state across various rollups. By leveraging NEAR DA, NFFL provides a fast, universal, and secure finality layer. It enhances block finality across different protocols and integrates additional public DA layers into the blockchain stack, paving the way for innovative cross-chain applications. NFFL is currently live on testnet––learn more <a href="https://nffl.nethermind.io/">about the protocol</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s next for Nuffle Labs?</strong></p>



<p>“We are thrilled about the incredible opportunity to grow and develop NEAR’s modular product offerings at Nuffle Labs,” said Altan Tutar, CEO of Nuffle Labs. The other Nuffle co-founders are Sam Wang, Firat Sertgoz, and Donovan Dall. “We deeply appreciate the support from the NEAR Foundation and are honored by the validation from such distinguished investors. Their confidence in our vision and capabilities energizes us as we continue to innovate and expand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Nuffle Labs will focus on advancing the development of the NFFL AVS on EigenLayer and further enhancing the robustness and efficiency of NEAR DA to support Ethereum’s rollup-centric future. The team is committed to furthering innovation in modular blockchain design and defragmenting the Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>The NEAR Foundation, in partnership with D3, a leading digital infrastructure provider specializing in domains, is applying to obtain the &#8216;.near&#8217; Top-Level Domain (TLD) during the upcoming ICANN application window. The collaboration will integrate D3’s interoperable digital identities into the NEAR ecosystem, enhancing utility for both users and developers.</p>



<p>Integrating web domains and the existing Domain Name System (DNS) presents a significant opportunity to advance mainstream adoption of the open web. With over <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907783392/en/DNIB.com-Reports-Internet-Has-356.6-Million-Domain-Name-Registrations-at-the-End-of-the-Second-Quarter-of-2023">356 million domains</a> currently using the DNS and more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5.3 billion internet users</a> worldwide, decentralized and interoperable domains could be a game-changer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is to catalyze mainstream adoption by extending NEAR’s reach beyond the blockchain community to include the broader Internet infrastructure. The partnership between NEAR and D3 highlights the importance of interoperability in achieving widespread adoption of the open web, offering users and developers enhanced utility and a more expansive definition of identity.</p>



<p>Users will have the ability to use a single domain for various functions, such as a website, email address, or wallet address, and will also serve verified credentials within the NEAR ecosystem.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re excited to work with D3 to secure the .near top-level domain and extend the power of NEAR accounts across the entire internet. As the functionality of NEAR accounts expands with Chain Abstraction, combining Web3 identity with existing internet infrastructure will help drive mainstream adoption,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol and Chief Executive Officer of the NEAR Foundation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-merging-domains-and-identity-for-an-accessible-open-web">Merging domains and identity for an accessible open web</h2>



<p>D3’s patent-pending technologies enable Web3 digital identities to be interoperable with the Internet, using the DNS as a foundation. Through these interoperable, human-readable digital identities – i.e. alice.near – users can use a single domain as a website, email, or wallet address. This also opens up the potential for cross-platform usernames through verified credentials.</p>



<p>For the NEAR ecosystem, this means broader utility for developers and projects building on the open web, using identities that are interoperable between the traditional Web2 internet and a decentralized open web. As D3 helps expand functionality of NEAR accounts, along with Chain Abstraction, it potentially paves the way for broader mainstream Web3 adoption.</p>



<p>“In order for Web3 to accelerate its growth, it will require interoperability with existing Internet infrastructure,” says Fred Hsu, Chief Executive Officer at D3. “We’re pleased to welcome NEAR on our journey to redefine digital identity, while offering NEAR users and projects alike more utility by bringing the ‘web’ to Web3.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bringing-identity-innovation-to-the-near-ecosystem">Bringing identity innovation to the NEAR ecosystem</h2>



<p>The collaboration with D3 to bridge the traditional internet and the open web using domains could lead to a host of innovative use cases on NEAR, from NFTs to SocialFi. Furthermore, D3’s mission of integrating traditional internet and Web3 for utility, security, and universal access dovetails with the NEAR ecosystem’s chain abstraction initiative. Making Web3 experiences feel familiar and smooth, while abstracting the blockchain hurdles away from end users, will improve the usability of decentralized applications for mainstream internet consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation announced today that the Protocol Work Group will launch testing for Phase 2 of Sharding this week, marking a major milestone in the network’s development roadmap. Phase 2 introduces fundamental upgrades to NEAR’s core protocol architecture, enabling even greater scalability and decentralization for the network. The fourth edition of <a href="https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv">Stake Wars</a>, an incentivized community testing initiative, will kick off on February 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR&#8217;s vision of <a href="/blog/why-chain-abstraction-is-the-next-frontier-for-web3">chain abstraction</a> to facilitate broad adoption of decentralized apps requires an extremely scalable blockchain layer. From the start, NEAR has been designed to scale with demand towards mainstream adoption. A primary benefit of the new sharding implementation will be an up-to-10x speed improvement to NEAR’s already-fast transaction throughput. Sharding is NEAR’s unique approach to scaling, which partitions the blockchain into multiple parallel “shards.” Combined with NEAR already having the lowest transaction fees in Web3, this sharding upgrade positions NEAR at the forefront of Web3 in terms of both performance and scalability. Phase 2 greatly improves the network’s capacity for end user volume and is an important landmark on the road to global-scale usage of Web3. </p>



<p>“NEAR continues to make progress on bringing Chain Abstraction infrastructure that can scale to a billion users and beyond,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol and CEO of NEAR Foundation. “The scalability improvements from stateless validation can unlock even better user experiences for more end-user applications, whether multichain DeFi-style dapps or those aimed at mainstream users.”</p>



<p>Phase 2 introduces the most significant changes to the NEAR Protocol since its Mainnet launch in 2020. The biggest of these is the implementation of stateless validation: an innovative approach to state change, or the process of updating the status of all the data posted to the blockchain. Now, NEAR validators no longer have to maintain the state of a shard locally and can retrieve all the information they need to validate state changes, or &#8220;state witness,&#8221; from the network. </p>



<p>With stateless validation, NEAR can finally achieve the truest form of sharding, where shards can function mostly independently at the consensus level to improve decentralization and throughput while preserving the highest security guarantees. An added benefit is that the hardware requirements to run most validator nodes are dramatically reduced (a smaller number of “chunk proposer” validators with specialized hardware will validate blocks with state held in memory). This also paves the way for greater decentralization of the network by lowering the barrier to entry to become a validator.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re very excited about the potential for future proofing the NEAR protocol design with stateless validation,” said Bowen Wang, Director of Protocol at Pagoda. “From a research perspective, we expect that as zero-knowledge tech matures, more protocols will adopt a similar approach, where a smaller set of expensive machines execute transactions and produce proofs, while a bigger validator set validates the proofs. This will enable more unified security across networks and defragment Web3, advancing a key aspect of the chain abstraction vision.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phase 2 is a shift in direction from the original Nightshade sharding architecture NEAR launched with in 2020, bypassing some fundamental roadblocks in that protocol design around the implementation of challenges in the initial idea of Phase 2, while also unlocking additional benefits. Other network improvements in Phase 2 include in-memory trie, wherein validator nodes can load the entire state into RAM for maximized performance. This will greatly improve transaction throughput thanks to minimizing storage access.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZwmjWx8WpvKyALYbwkVVS7-9_UOnvFaSrb7M6zTVxPdKPeg01hmwD5IybX8sOd0TKasPv8qmFE5sHD_w0A4j1R4CGurstJmXZwv_rbKN5gRpAcynJyej3U7X0PhYmRWVyEysYaiuOI7Sz2NGJGOPBhM" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Phase 2 is the third major upgrade to NEAR Protocol’s sharding since Mainnet launch in October 2020, showcasing the incredible shipping speed of the protocol engineering team.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p></p>



<p>NEAR users should not experience any downtime with the transition to Phase 2 and no special action is required from validators, apart from adjusting hardware specs. Through dozens of protocol upgrades since Mainnet launch, including three major upgrades, the core NEAR protocol has had 100% uptime with zero disruption for developers and end users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, February 1, <strong>Stake Wars IV: Attack of the Transactions</strong> will launch to incentivize battle testing of the new sharding architecture. Planned to run through March 31, the latest edition of Stake Wars invites community members to test features and generate traffic. For more information about participating and deeper technical detail about Phase 2, visit the Stake Wars <a href="https://github.com/near/stakewars-iv">page on Github</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the launch of Phase 2, NEAR becomes one of the only networks in Web3 to implement stateless validation to improve scaling and paves the way for further network performance and scalability improvements in the future roadmap. A technical paper with more detail about NEAR’s new sharding design is forthcoming later in Q1. Phase 2 is expected to launch on NEAR Mainnet in May 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NEAR is now compatible with MetaMask, one of the most popular wallets in Web3! For the first time, MetaMask users will be able to create NEAR accounts, sign NEAR Protocol transactions, and use a host of other features natively inside the MetaMask wallet thanks to the new <a href="https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/near-snap/plugin/">NEAR Snap</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NEAR Snap was developed by <a href="https://www.herewallet.app/">HERE Wallet</a> (led by Petr Volnov and Andrey Zhevlakov) and supported by the <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan Collective</a>. NEAR Snap is one of several integrations in the recently launched MetaMask Snap ecosystem, a series of apps developed by independent teams across Web3 looking to expand the functionality of the MetaMask Wallet experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The launch of NEAR Snap makes the MetaMask ecosystem more accessible to the NEAR community. While Aurora, as an EVM compatible blockchain, can already be operated inside MetaMask, NEAR Snap is the first time NEAR transactions can be supported natively in MetaMask. Snaps allows for greater interoperability between blockchains, as MetaMask is also&nbsp; able to interact and sign transactions on other non-EVM chains including NEAR, Solana, Cosmos, Tezos, Bitcoin, Sui, Aptos, Algorand, and others. Innovations like Snaps contribute to creating a frictionless Web3 experience for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-new-near-capabilities">Unlocking new NEAR Capabilities&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In its first iteration, NEAR Snap allows MetaMask users to interact directly with the NEAR Protocol, but NEAR Snap isn’t stopping there. As part of its ongoing development, the <a href="https://nearbuilders.com/">NEAR builders</a> community plans to develop BOS components to enable web wallet-like functionalities through a set of different gateways for not just NEAR Snaps, but also for other wallets in the ecosystem. NEAR Snap is also creating an easy integration for other dApps in the NEAR Ecosystem. Dapps can start integrating with NEAR Snaps via the <a href="https://github.com/near/wallet-selector">NEAR Wallet Selector</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to use NEAR applications with Metamask</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Assuming you already have a Metamask wallet, open <a href="https://my.herewallet.app/">https://my.herewallet.app/</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click “I Already Have An Account”</li>



<li>Click “Metamask Snap”</li>



<li>Confirm transactions in via Metamask extension titled “Third-party software notice”, “Connection Request”, “Installation Request”, and “Sign Message”</li>



<li>Create a .near username / “nickname”</li>



<li>Approve transactions asking for your public data, to add a nickname to the account, and to sign message</li>



<li>Use any of the applications that support NEAR Snap via the “HERE Connector”: <a href="https://my.herewallet.app/">https://my.herewallet.app/</a></li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faq">FAQ</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isn-t-metamask-already-supported-through-aurora">Isn’t MetaMask already supported through Aurora?</h3>



<p>Yes. Aurora is an EVM compatible blockchain, which means you can switch networks to Aurora within MetaMask. However, the NEAR Snap allows you to support transactions on NEAR’s non-EVM shards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-the-near-snap-do-for-bos">What does the NEAR Snap do for BOS?</h3>



<p>The NEAR Snap can be added to BOS gateways so that EVM + NEAR experiences can both be in one wallet. Additionally, the power of BOS can bridge the gap of a lack of GUI to provide a wallet front end for not only the NEAR SNAP but other chain SNAPs as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-this-different-from-the-neth-implementation-made-by-proximity">How is this different from the NETH implementation made by Proximity?</h3>



<p>NETH is a smart contract designed to enable your Ethereum account to sign transactions and remotely manage your paired NEAR account. This allows you to directly interact with NEAR decentralized applications (dApps) using your Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask. Essentially, it acts as a proxy that facilitates Ethereum-view transactions on the NEAR network. This functions as a separate EVM network, but has many limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, Snap is a miniature application that allows you to create and sign regular NEAR-view transactions. These mini-applications are typically opened from the websites where the signing process is required. Within these mini-applications, you can sign, review the transaction, and perform other related actions. Nevertheless, the user cannot open them as a separate network within MetaMask and view balances independently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-is-this-different-from-remote-accounts-coming-to-near">How is this different from remote accounts coming to NEAR?</h3>



<p>Remote Accounts are the concept that you can use NEAR to to sign transactions on other blockchains, simply put. This concept’s implementation is still under development and being discussed on <a href="https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/498">Github</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NEAR Foundation’s vision has always been to help the world create a truly Open Web, giving all people full control of their data, privacy, and power of governance. In 2023, the NEAR ecosystem saw remarkable progress towards this vision, with the NEAR Protocol now home to three of the top ten apps in Web3, a record number of daily users, and closer collaboration than ever with the Ethereum community.<br></p>



<p>With the NEAR Foundation Council (NFC), we&#8217;ve conducted a thorough review of the Foundation’s activities. During this process, we heard feedback that the Foundation has not always been as effective as it could be, sometimes moving too slowly and trying to do too many things at once. Following this review, we have decided to significantly consolidate the core Foundation team to focus on a narrower and higher-impact set of activities.&nbsp;Over time, Foundation’s footprint will continue to contract as the ecosystem further decentralizes and various nodes drive more activity in the network and across the ecosystem.<br></p>



<p>As part of this realignment, NEAR Foundation will reduce its team by approximately 40%, impacting 35 colleagues, primarily across the marketing, business development, and community teams. The NEAR Protocol Engineering Team at Pagoda will continue to operate as it has. The NEAR Foundation will provide support to affected colleagues during this time to help them find new opportunities in the NEAR ecosystem, the Web3 industry, and beyond. We thank each of our departing colleagues for your efforts and contributions towards our shared vision of the Open Web.<br><br>The NEAR Foundation treasury remains strong and well-managed, with over $285m fiat, 305m NEAR (worth over $1B), and $70m of investments and loans. The Foundation is well-placed to continue to support the ongoing growth, development, and further decentralization of the NEAR Protocol and ecosystem.<br></p>



<p>Thank you to everyone in the NEAR community for your ongoing efforts and support. We are excited to move forward with more focus, more efficiency, and more speed. We’ll share more updates soon about what comes next as we work to advance chain abstraction, user-owned AI, and mainstream adoption of the Open Web.<br></p>



<p>Keep building,</p>



<p>Illia<br></p>
