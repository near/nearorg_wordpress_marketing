<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to share that <a href="https://infinex.xyz/">Infinex</a>, a decentralized exchange platform with seamless, multichain user experience, will begin integrating NEAR Chain Signatures and NEAR Intents as a major step to bring Infinex closer to feature parity with centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infinex, founded by Synthetix creator <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne">Kain Warwick</a>, aims to abstract away UX challenges and complexities at the core of DeFi. Whereas it was once impossible to enable DeFi compatibility for non-smart contract assets and to custody them securely on-chain, Infinex is making DeFi more seamless. Without integrating every chain, DeFi experiences remain fragmented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR Chain Signatures enable users to sign transactions on third-party blockchains from a single account. By integrating with NEAR Chain Signatures, Infinex users can control and interact with non-smart contract chains like Bitcoin and Ripple from their existing accounts. In the coming months, users can trade these assets natively on the platform via NEAR Intents.</p>



<p>“Infinex is a monolithic platform that will accelerate the extinction of centralized exchanges,” said Warwick. “To do this, we’re thrilled to partner with NEAR to connect legacy chains like Litecoin and XRP to DeFi.” Infinex CTO Jed Watson added, “This is a major unlock for us. Our smart contract architecture is key to how we combine groundbreaking UX with on-chain transparency and funds recovery. With NEAR, we can bring the same functionality to chains like Bitcoin, offering users genuine self-custody of native assets without compromise.”</p>



<p>NEAR Foundation is proud to be the primary Chain Abstraction partner for Infinex and help support their mission to improve DeFi usability and accessibility. “I am excited to see Infinex tackle the important work of onboarding users into self-custody with a strong focus on user experience,” said Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol. “NEAR has been pushing this vision of chain abstraction and ease of use since the start in 2018, so it’s great to partner with a prolific builder like Kain and the team at Infinex to make this vision a reality for the next generation of users.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a major step forward for the NEAR Protocol’s (NEAR) vision of Chain Abstraction—seamless interoperability across all blockchains—Ethereum users are now able to freely interact with NEAR applications using MetaMask, Phantom, or other ETH wallets. This NEAR Wallet Selector integration for Ethereum wallets was built by Aurora Labs.</p>



<p>NEAR will now have direct exposure to the Ethereum community, further reducing the friction of users having to create NEAR wallets before interacting with NEAR/multichain apps. All Ethereum users—and this is particularly relevant to DeFi users—now have access to the benefits of Chain Signatures and Chain Abstraction apps, with no new wallets or assets needed. Developers and teams can directly embed the Ethereum wallet selector in their apps, allowing users to sign in using MetaMask or the ETH wallet of their choice.</p>



<p>NEAR co-founder and CEO Illia Polosukhin comments: “Enabling all Ethereum wallets, including MetaMask, to sign in on NEAR apps closes another gap in achieving Chain Abstraction. ETH users are now able to explore experiences on NEAR and other chains without needing to switch wallets. This is a big step forward for simpler onboarding and defragmenting liquidity and access for DeFi users, bringing all of Web3 closer to achieving the Chain Abstraction vision.”</p>



<p>Aurora Labs is the project behind Aurora, a network of Virtual Chains that combines NEAR’s scalability with powerful infrastructure for the easy deployment of preconfigured blockchains.</p>



<p>“By integrating Ethereum wallets into NEAR’s ecosystem,” said Aurora Labs’ CEO Alex Shevchenko, “we streamline access and enhance the developer experience. Developers can now build apps that seamlessly serve both NEAR and Ethereum users, simplifying onboarding and expanding liquidity channels. This is a crucial step toward a unified Web3 where users and capital move freely across ecosystems.”</p>



<p>A short list of NEAR partners implementing the Ethereum wallet integration includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://testnet.thunderhood.com/home">Thunderhood</a></li>



<li><a href="https://burrow.finance/">Burrow.finance</a></li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation announces today the formation of two new ecosystem nodes: Near One is spinning out of Pagoda and a Chain Abstraction team is launching with members from Pagoda and Proximity Labs. In line with the NEAR ecosystem&#8217;s commitment to decentralization, these teams are spinning out key initiatives that have reached sufficient maturity. They join earlier spinouts including Aurora, Calimero, DevHub, and most recently Nuffle Labs, in becoming independent companies. </p>



<p>Spinouts of NEAR ecosystem initiatives allow teams to focus on their core competencies and move quickly and autonomously with clear and aligned incentives. Importantly, an open and decentralized ecosystem encourages transparency and gives everyone a fair chance to seek funding and support for their contributions. A decentralized ecosystem is also more antifragile and sustainable due to an ever-increasing number of collaborating and competing projects.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Near One</h4>



<p>The Pagoda team developing the core NEAR blockchain protocol is now <a href="http://nearone.org/">Near One</a>, a team of 30 employees led by Bowen Wang, Head of Protocol. Near One’s mandate is to develop and maintain the NEAR Protocol and roadmap, providing high-performance and scalable infrastructure to support the wide range of activities in the NEAR ecosystem, including consumer apps, Chain Abstraction, modularity, DeFi, and User-Owned AI. Working independently will allow Near One to operate with greater speed and autonomy, and also makes room for multiple node/protocol teams to build on NEAR without relying on an “official” one. Near One will share exciting news about the next phase of sharding later this month.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chain Abstraction Spinout</h4>



<p>Following the successful launch of <a href="/blog/chain-signatures-mainnet-launches/">Chain Signatures</a> mainnet, an independent team with key contributors from Pagoda and other nodes will focus on developing the technology and partnerships needed to make the Chain Abstraction vision a reality. This new team will continue the NEAR ecosystem’s leadership in advancing Chain Abstraction for all of Web3. More information and a name for this project are forthcoming in September, so stay tuned.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Future of Pagoda and Pagoda Services</h4>



<p>Given that these two spinouts represent a large percentage of Pagoda’s current staff and responsibilities, the NEAR Foundation Council decided to change the model for funding the other ecosystem services Pagoda has been operating. These will now be distributed via the <a href="https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group">Infrastructure Committee</a> to a decentralized set of providers over the next six months. For updates on Pagoda’s transition timeline and process, please consult this <a href="https://docs.near.org/blog/2024-08-13-pagoda-services">Future of Pagoda Services</a> page.</p>



<p>These transitions mean that Pagoda will be winding down, with some Pagoda employees joining other ecosystem nodes including the NEAR Foundation, NEAR.AI, and DevHub teams. Remaining team members will be offered support to found new ecosystem projects, join other ecosystem teams, or bid as independent providers to take over existing work via an RFP process run by the Infrastructure Committee. People with strong knowledge of NEAR technologies are always encouraged to start new projects and seek funding support: this is the most transparent, fair, and sustainable approach for growing the ecosystem as it approaches 4 years since mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR ecosystem teams interested in hiring Pagoda team members are encouraged to share openings on the <a href="https://careers.near.org/jobs">Jobs Board</a> and to consult this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12XYaf4SZN5s4AgyFwp27IDvn21BpvKxuZMgp2C9VHhY/edit?resourcekey=&amp;gid=761891858#gid=761891858">opt-in list</a> of people open to new roles. There will also be a hacker house-style Pagoda offsite in Tarrytown, New York in early September, now open to ecosystem contributors interested in connecting with team members and brainstorming independent projects (apply to attend <a href="https://forms.gle/QBtKMBRoPqM3ripc8">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking Ahead</h4>



<p>In addition to the launch of Chain Signatures mainnet last week and the upcoming mainnet launch of Nightshade 2.0, the NEAR ecosystem has seen major recent success across a range of key metrics. Last month, in July 2024, the NEAR ecosystem had more than 20 million monthly active users across apps and projects––the highest on any L1 chain, with over 110 million accounts overall. NEAR also reached over 3 million daily active users, the highest of any chain, averaging between six and seven million transactions per day, and has the highest 12-month user retention among L1 blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A more decentralized and autonomous ecosystem of independent projects will be better equipped to expand on this impressive growth and bring NEAR’s vision and best-in-class technology to a billion users. Those interested in keeping up with the latest news and launches on NEAR should follow along on <a href="https://x.com/nearprotocol">X</a>, attend monthly ecosystem <a href="https://lu.ma/3lit1jwx">Town Halls</a>, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9tzQn_TEuFWMuPiQOXhaE5lpOTnxLPZY">NEAR AI Office Hours</a>, and attend the [REDACTED] <a href="https://redactedbangkok.ai/">conference and hackathon</a> in Bangkok, Nov. 9-11.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation announces the launch of Nuffle Labs, a new venture spinning out from Pagoda and the NEAR Foundation. Founded by the core contributors to the NEAR Data Availability Layer (NEAR DA) and the NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL), the NEAR Modular product suite is now spinning out into an independent entity dedicated to improving and amplifying NEAR’s modularity offerings. The new entity has secured $13 million in funding, including a strategic grant from NEAR Foundation and external investment led by Electric Capital.</p>



<p>The spinout of Nuffle Labs reflects not only the strength of the core team and the products they are building, but also illustrates the Foundation’s commitment to decentralization by turning core functions over to proven teams in the ecosystem. As an independent team, Nuffle Labs will be better positioned to operate at the forefront of modular blockchain design, nurture its own decentralized community, and forge more partnerships across the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nuffle Labs will leverage NEAR Protocol’s cost-effective, fast, and proven technology to offer rollups enhanced modularity. It is responsible for two key products in NEAR’s modular suite: NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) and NEAR Fast Finality Layer, now Nuffle Fast Finality Layer (NFFL).</p>



<p><strong>Nuffle Labs secures $13M in funding to support their growth</strong></p>



<p>Nuffle Labs’ spinout comes with substantial investment, including a strategic grant from the NEAR Foundation as well as funding from external investors including Electric Capital, Canonical Crypto, Fabric Ventures, Robot Ventures, Caladan, and Lyrik Ventures. Notable angel investors include Jordi Alexander (Selini), Blackdragon VC, Bowen Wang (NEAR), Sreeram Kannan (EigenLayer), Sam Kazemian (Frax), Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), DeFi Dad (4RC), Dovey Wan (Primitive Ventures), and Mert Mumtaz (Helius). With these resources and supporters, the team is well-equipped to advance NEAR DA and NFFL, expand the team, invest in R&amp;D, and build a strong community that spans across NEAR, Ethereum, and beyond.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re proud to support the growth of Nuffle Labs as an independent company in the NEAR ecosystem. These 4 excellent co-founders have built first-rate modularity products that showcase the best of NEAR&#8217;s technology with NEAR DA and NFFL, providing cost-effective and performant solutions to projects across Web3,” said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol and CEO of NEAR Foundation. “We look forward to continued collaboration with the NEAR Foundation as they expand and evolve.”</p>



<p>Avichal Garg, General Partner at lead investor Electric Capital, said, “We are excited to back Nuffle Labs, the builders behind NEAR DA and the NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL). As the core team that developed these products from the ground up, Nuffle Labs has the expertise to advance these modular solutions, creating a world where intra- and interchain transactions are cheap, fast, and secure.”</p>



<p>“I have had the great privilege of getting to know the founders of Nuffle and working with them from day zero,” said Anand Iyer, General Partner at Canonical Crypto. “Their passion for solving blockchain scaling combined with their expertise from building solutions at NEAR has me genuinely excited for them and their future.”</p>



<p><strong>Understanding NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA)</strong></p>



<p>NEAR DA utilizes the sharded architecture of NEAR Protocol to provide a modular data availability layer for Ethereum rollups with extremely high throughput and low cost. On mainnet launch, RSS3 – an open information protocol bridging AI and Web3 – experienced a substantial cost reduction, paying a daily average of $10 compared to their previous $1,000. NEAR DA currently has a throughput of 24MB/s, significantly higher than its closest competitor’s 6.67MB/s – making NEAR DA the most scalable, cheapest, and reliable DA solution on the market.</p>



<p>NEAR DA’s scalability is further enhanced by its ability to support multiple rollups, whether they are optimistic or ZK-rollups. NEAR Data Availability (NEAR DA) provides:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cost-efficiency: Storing data on NEAR Protocol is significantly cheaper than on Ethereum, making it easier for projects to build as well as faster.</li>



<li>Effortless Validation: NEAR Protocol&#8217;s trustless off-chain light client simplifies validation, ensuring accurate and reliable transactions.</li>



<li>User-Friendly Interaction: NEAR Protocol provides easy access to on-chain data through RPC, making blockchain interaction seamless for developers and users.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exploring NEAR Fast Finality Layer (NFFL)</strong></p>



<p>The name Nuffle Labs is derived from the acronym NFFL. The Nuffle Fast Finality Layer (NFFL) is an EigenLayer Actively Validated Service (AVS) designed to aggregate state across various rollups. By leveraging NEAR DA, NFFL provides a fast, universal, and secure finality layer. It enhances block finality across different protocols and integrates additional public DA layers into the blockchain stack, paving the way for innovative cross-chain applications. NFFL is currently live on testnet––learn more <a href="https://nffl.nethermind.io/">about the protocol</a>.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s next for Nuffle Labs?</strong></p>



<p>“We are thrilled about the incredible opportunity to grow and develop NEAR’s modular product offerings at Nuffle Labs,” said Altan Tutar, CEO of Nuffle Labs.
