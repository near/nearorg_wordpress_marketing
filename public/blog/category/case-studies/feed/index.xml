										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In everyday life, fist bumps are used to create, celebrate, deepen connections between two humans. In Web3 the core concept is the same, only this time, the two humans are replaced by a user and DapDap, and a fist bump that connects you to a world of Ethereum L2s and dApps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DapDap is a universal gateway to Ethereum L2s, and multiple protocols across Web3. Built with the vision to make Web3 accessible for everyone, the platform consolidates the user journey of multiple dApps and protocols into a single interface, enhancing discoverability, simplifying onboarding and abstracting the need to interact individually with each one.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WHY DAPDAP?</strong></p>



<p>Ethereum L2s were introduced to help the protocol scale. While that decompressed all the pressure of high transaction volumes, it created another problem, fragmentation. There are over 55 Ethereum L2s currently active, with another 40+ in the works. Both numbers are growing every day. $40b TVL on L2s strongly implies there are users, but how efficient and tenable is the users’ journey of having to log in to these protocols separately, or keep up with new mainnets rolling out?  Enter DapDap! Streamlining user experience by uniting the discoverability, accessibility and engagement of the L2 ecosystem on a single interface that dilutes the friction and multiple barriers to entries caused by fragmentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HOW DAPDAP FUNCTIONS</strong></p>



<p>Built as a decentralized frontend on NEAR, DapDap leverages the protocol’s Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S) and NEAR JS to deliver a user interface that allows users to quickly navigate, conveniently access, and fully engage with Ethereum L2s and a wide array of protocols.</p>



<p>NEAR provided the perfect chassis upon which DapDap could mount, thanks to:</p>



<p>&#8211; The B.O.S, which makes decentralized frontends possible on NEAR, and enabled the Dap Dap team to build an interface that abstracts the multiple UIs of the different protocols.</p>



<p>&#8211; The developer-friendliness of NEAR’s tech stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; NEAR JS not only offers flexibility and composability, it simplifies developer experience with its familiar syntax and environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>EXPLORE DAPDAP’S MOST COMPELLING FEATURES;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol>
<li><strong>ODYSSEY</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Discoverability and simplified accessibility are great answers to the why of Dap Dap, but the “how” element is what makes this imaginary fist bump between users and a unified interface for Ethereum L2s, a winner. DapDap answered the how, with Odyssey, a gamified engagement experience that makes the user journey fun and rewarding. Odyssey is presented as an ever-evolving series of familiar challenges like spin-to-win or match-to-win, etc, compiled into volumes. Each volume, composed of missions, represents the discovery and onboarding of a new L2 or protocol. Users&#8217; engagement with Odyssey is rewarded with DapDap points, which have multiple utilities, all yet to be disclosed by the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far, DapDap has completed five Odyssey volumes:</p>



<p>&#8211; Odyssey Volume 1: Uncharted Realms</p>



<p>&#8211; Odyssey Volume 2: Beyond Linea</p>



<p>&#8211; Odyssey Volume 3: Scroll Expedition</p>



<p>&#8211; Odyssey Volume 4: Blast Gold Rush</p>



<p>&#8211; Odyssey Volume 4+: Blast Gold Rush Reloaded</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>THE SUPER BRIDGE</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>DapDap’s Super Bridge is an aggregation of all bridging services in the DapDap ecosystem into a single, unified interface. It allows users complete control and preference setting of their experience thanks to comprehensive and convenient filtering, and customization features.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc5m0CBrB-stHWcCB6wqh4Us5MSe73SGPieZuL5KvuxZJ-4nXomZ1UgmcRzGctKdHafbSIXL3YB91h2UbokNvoO2ueJc-fri2RDXrn5UTlXTQquuUoBwRSgHcienIsR7RfVUq2yufJJSuhxre6zc96_rUk?key=5XbiwzBMuk19vjunqhEGHw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The Super Bridge daps users into access to over 45 Ethereum L2 bridges across 17 different networks, including Wormhole, Arbitrum Native, Stargate, Gnosis, Polygon PoS, Optimism gateway, Bungee, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>LOOKING FORWARD</strong></p>



<p>Only a few months into its existence, DapDap has already captured over 300+ dApps, including 15+ Ethereum L2s, over $6m in Scroll transaction volume on the platform, and over 150k users, with each L2 recording 2-4k users on average. Names like Arbitrum, Blast, Scroll, Base, Mantle, Gnosis, and Linda, already have frontends on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These numbers and rapid growth strongly indicate that users will quickly drift towards platforms that can significantly simplify and streamline their user experience and journey.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a recent interview, when asked about the position of HERE and HOT wallet, HERE CEO and founder, Peter Volnov, had a really clear picture of what he wanted them to be, referring to them as the “VISA/MasterCard of Web3”. The analogy captured both the present status and future ambitions of his products, and we couldn’t help but take a deeper dive into what he meant.</p>



<p>HERE is a platform on NEAR, that builds non-custodial wallets focused on user experience that lowers the barrier entry into Web3, and security. The team currently has two products out: </p>



<p>&#8211; <strong>HERE wallet</strong>, a non-custodial Web and mobile wallet offering an all-in-one DeFi experience to users.</p>



<p>&#8211; <strong>HOT wallet</strong>, a non-custodial Web3 wallet for Telegram, featuring a gamified user journey.</p>



<p>Both wallets focus on delivering ease-of-use and familiarity, but also target slightly different levels of the same audience.</p>



<p><strong>HERE WALLET</strong></p>



<p>In addition to being non-custodial, HERE Wallet offers a comprehensive DeFi experience with features such as liquid staking, NFTs, swaps, and more. Its mobile app enhances accessibility, making it a convenient option for users on the go. The wallet employs innovative yet familiar technologies like QR code scanning and offers gas-free transactions to further enhance the user experience.</p>



<p>The wallet’s comprehensiveness, combined with its convenience, makes it an easy yet powerful option for users exploring the NEAR ecosystem and already deeply entrenched in Web3.</p>



<p><strong>HOT WALLET</strong></p>



<p>Built primarily for Telegram, and newcomers into Web3, HOT focuses on delivering an engaging and simplified user experience through a gamified interface. It allows users to mine &#8220;fire droplets&#8221; as currency and join a community to collectively mine and earn more. While onboarding individual users is beneficial, building an incentivized community that can explore, discover, and experience the ecosystem’s value is even better. This approach also creates an organic marketing wheel and landing pad for incoming users.</p>



<p>Telegram is the 8th most used social media platform in the world, with 1.5 billion users globally, and over 190 million daily users. Its user base grew by 46% in 2024 and is projected to grow by another 46% by 2025. By intelligently leveraging Telegram, HOT provides a low-effort, high-reward gateway to Web3 on one of the biggest social media platforms in the world.</p>



<p>HOT wallet emphasizes onboarding and easing new users into the world of Web3, while HERE wallet becomes more of an option once the user is familiar with the basics and wants a more advanced experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WHY WEB3?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If you noticed that “non-custodial” is a premier feature for both wallets, it is largely because it is part of the Web3 ideal and a foundational tenet, and is closely tied to Peter’s experience with traditional banking. An experience that is shared and talked about by NEAR co-founder, Illia Polosukhin, in his article <a href="/blog/self-sovereignty-is-near-a-vision-for-our-ecosystem/">Self-Sovereignty is NEAR</a>. Web3 champions the value of full user ownership and control of their assets, from money to data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition Web3 unlocks robust and varying types of security that makes the responsibility of non-custodianship more attractive.</p>



<p>As a melting pot for technology that offers prime infrastructure for building robust products, thanks to a unique account model, and features like meta transactions (for gas free transactions), FastAuth (Web2-style security backed by blockchain) and chain signatures (enabling true interoperability), another one of NEAR’s notable attractions for the HERE team was how developer friendly and focused the tech stack was, making it easy to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IT’S HOT, IT’S HERE, IT’S NOW</strong></p>



<p>HOT wallet currently (as of June 10) has 9.5M users after launching in early 2024, while HERE accounts for over 50% of transactions on NEAR Protocol, with $130M in transactions signed via the wallet in May 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WE ARE HERE, WHAT NEXT?</strong></p>



<p>Aligned with NEAR’s <a href="/blog/why-chain-abstraction-is-the-next-frontier-for-web3/">Chain Abstraction vision</a>, HERE is looking to infuse their products with the next arc of Web3, a connected ecosystem that abstracts complexity and enables users to interact and access different blockchains from a single entry point (wallet).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vision for HOT wallet is to develop it into a protocol offering multiple chain abstracted use cases (NFT marketplace, cross-chain swaps, launchpad, discovery portal, MPC wallet, etc), without losing the core function of being a simplified gateway for new Web3 users. To that end, the HERE team has already been productive, delivering a launchpad and dApp gateway.</p>



<p>HERE is effectively building out an open ecosystem that takes full advantage of all NEAR has to offer to create value in Web3 that completely reverses the experience of traditional finance, and puts users firmly in control of their assets, data and journey, with a dash of fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since September 2023, CosmoseAI’s KAI-Ching has been number 1 dApp with the most Unique Active Wallets (UAW) in all of web3, hitting numbers like 700k Daily Active Wallets and 2 million Monthly Active Users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes KAI-Ching special? Turns out building around consumer empowerment that rewards the consumer and ensures their ownership can make you really popular. KAI-Ching is a mission-driven technology transforming consumer experience by saving them time with curated content and offerings, rewarding their engagement, and ensuring they have control and ownership of their data.</p>



<p><strong>A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO COSMOSE AI’s CORE PLATFORMS&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>KAIKAI</strong> is an AI-powered, opt-in interactive lock screen and mobile app that provides curated content and shopping based on the user’s preferences. By engaging with the provided content and/or shopping, users earn KAI-Ching.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>KAI-Ching</strong>, the heartbeat of the ecosystem, is a reward system integrated into Cosmose AI platforms, using a crypto-based token, $KAIC, to reward users for purchases and engagement on KAIKAI. These earned tokens can be accumulated and redeemed for discounts or full purchases on KAIKAI.</p>



<p><strong>THE WHY BEHIND KAIKAI &amp; KAI-CHING</strong></p>



<p>Consumer data basically equates to currency in the digital age, but traditional data-reliant consumer apps (think Facebook, Google, social media apps etc) have often fallen short in guaranteeing ownership, privacy or ethical use of consumer-generated data.</p>



<p>Cosmose AI founder Miron Mironiuk, sought to disrupt the trend: <em>“KAI-Ching was built to give users tangible benefits for their engagement, while ensuring that they retain ownership of the data.”</em></p>



<p><strong>MAKING THE KAI-ECOSYSTEM WORK</strong></p>



<p>CosmoseAI intelligently combined the best of blockchain technology and edge computing to deliver the essence of its platforms’ value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAI and KAI-Ching are powered by NEAR Protocol, a sharded and modular, AI Layer-1 blockchain, with low transaction fees, and super fast finality. NEAR’s dev-friendly infrastructure, negligible transaction fees, made it an ideal landing pad for the Cosmose AI team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain technology ensures user data ownership remains with the user, by enabling the user to permission what can be accessed or shared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21400" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram-1024x576.png 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram-300x169.png 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram-768x432.png 768w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram-1536x864.png 1536w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cosmose-diagram.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Unless you are digging deep into the architecture of KAI-Ching, you won’t know it runs on a blockchain, described by Miron in an interview as: <em>&#8220;Instead of talking about blockchain and Web3, we built products that became part of everyday life.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><strong>THE KAI-CHING JOURNEY SO FAR? KA-CHING!</strong></p>



<p>Since launching KAIKAI and KAI-Ching, Cosmose AI has onboarded over 10m users into Web3, consistently topping daily and monthly active wallet charts since 2023. The big success can be attributed to two primary things: </p>



<p>&#8211; Building on a developer-friendly blockchain, NEAR Protocol, that allows the team to cost-efficiently and seamlessly ship features, with speed and robust security.</p>



<p>&#8211; Focusing on user journey and experience to deliver platforms that are user-friendly AND deliver tangible, repetitive value to users’ everyday life.</p>



<p>The success of KAI-Ching and the CosmoseAI platforms is tangible proof that user-friendly consumer empowerment models work and can attract mass adoption, no matter the underlying infrastructure. As AI increasingly becomes a major narrative in Web3 and focuses on enhancing everyday consumer preferences, KAI-Ching positions itself as a pioneer abstracted solution for the future of consumer apps.<br><br>Discover the world of KAIKAI now<br><a href="https://kaikai.ai/">https://kaikai.ai/</a> </p>

In these Case Study videos, NEAR Foundation showcases some of these projects.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the latest NEAR Foundation Case Study video, viewers hear from Laura Cunningham, Team Lead at NEAR Horizon and General Manager at NEAR Foundation. NEAR Horizon is a Web3 accelerator program revolutionizing how founders and builders receive support in the open web. Laura takes viewers on a deep dive into Horizon’s startup accelerator marketplace, which the Horizon team built on the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). </p>



<p>“The BOS was our platform of choice for building NEAR Horizon because it makes Horizon much more accessible to founders and projects that are already in the ecosystem. And then ones coming in new, you can be building on another chain as long as you have some component of your stack on NEAR then you can apply and be part of NEAR Horizon,  ” she adds. “It is also incredibly composable, so we were able to fork different attributes that were already available on BOS and make use of them in our front end, so it made it a lot quicker to actually develop.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.thespotroom.com/">Solaire</a> – an exciting web3 retail platform that merges physical and digital assets – is revolutionizing the way consumers interact with fashion brands. By harnessing the power of web3 and the NEAR blockchain, Solaire is building out key protocol infrastructure and APIs that will expand decentralized retail and unlock new opportunities for both shoppers and fashion brands alike.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Solaire is pioneering phygital use cases and brands will be able to leverage the NEAR blockchain in tandem with Solair’s powerful APIs to engage with their audience in novel ways.  Solaire&#8217;s suite of APIs seamlessly integrates with a brand&#8217;s existing retail channels. This enables new revenue channels and richer data. </p>



<p></p>



<p>Solaire’s entire backend is fully on-chain and facilitates an easy-to-use web2 interface, with no wallet or crypto needed from shoppers. The NEAR blockchain helps Solaire provide these benefits for brands, as well as unique integrations with NEAR. This includes Solaire integration with the NEAR Mainnet, native NEAR wallet support, and the NEAR token as a payment option.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-solaire-is-changing-fashion-with-phygital">How Solaire is Changing Fashion with Phygital</h2>



<p>Solaire establishes a 1:1 connection between a physical object and its digital twin. Brands can then leverage Solaire’s infrastructure and suite of APIs to engage customers with NFTs and phygital experiences in a seamless, user-friendly way, removing some of the typical web3 friction points.</p>



<p></p>



<p>“We aim to do all the hard work on the backend so that brands and consumers can enjoy a familiar user experience with all the benefits of Web3 but without the hassle of dealing with wallet or crypto,” says Vivian Zhang, CEO of Solaire. “And NEAR&#8217;s blockchain is perfectly suited to run enterprise-level protocols to ensure a seamless and frictionless user experience.&#8221;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Soliare infrastructure helps brands create meaningful digital twins for physical goods, as well as providing a means for consumers to buy and trade phygital assets. Solaire allows for minting unique NFTs attached to physical goods and offers an end-to-end solution for securing and tracking a product from manufacturing through its entire product lifecycle.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Solaire has already collaborated with major fashion brands like <a href="https://freemanjewelry.com/">Freeman&#8217;s Limited Edition Phygital Harry Potter™</a> Collection and <a href="https://www.ilonasong.com/">Ilona Song</a>. Smart contracts facilitate shipping, returns, and exchanges all on the NEAR blockchain This allows customers to shop and purchase with transparency and confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-of-phygital-assets-for-fashion-brands">Benefits of Phygital Assets for Fashion Brands</h2>



<p>Phygital assets are a new way for fashion brands to engage consumers, combining the physical and digital worlds to create a more immersive shopping experience. For example, when a customer buys a dress in real life, they also receive a digital wearable. This can be in the form of an AR filter, a digital skin in their favorite game, or to wear in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>“Solaire&#8217;s mission is to empower the retail industry with web3 tools to cultivate a more connected and automated ecosystem,” Zhang continues. “With our suite of APIs, brands are able to maximize revenue and gain valuable data from digital assets, facilitate the secondary market, and build community.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>Brands can then use Solaire as a powerful CRM tool. Through the digital twin in customers&#8217; wallets, brands will have a constant open channel of communication with both the primary customer and secondary owners. Smart contracts also automate royalties from secondary selling, giving brands visibility into trading data.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Another exciting feature is the secondary market experience brands can now provide. Solaire’s backend enables peer-to-peer physical asset trading without a middleman, utilizing blockchain-secured data and smart contracts. Buyers and sellers can independently confirm possession and authenticity of assets on-chain, and smart contracts resolve any disputes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solaire-and-near-building-a-phygital-fashion-future">Solaire and NEAR Building a Phygital Fashion Future</h2>



<p>&#8220;We’re building on NEAR because it champions community, and it’s one we have found to be incredibly supportive,” remarks Vivian Zhang, CEO of Solaire. “We’ve been able to connect and collaborate with so many partners as we build an entire retail ecosystem together on NEAR.”</p>



<p>As fashion brands recognize the value of web3, NFTs, and phygital technology as important audience touchpoints, Solaire has the potential to partner with even more fashion brands and designers. Solaire’s game-changing approach and tech stack – aided by the NEAR blockchain – will bring web3 to more fashionistas without some of the usual pain points.</p>



<p>“Together with NEAR, we hope to lay out the Web3 infrastructure for the retail industry to onboard the next billion users into web3,&#8221; concluded Zhang. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Music, sports, and entertainment ticketing is about to be completely reimagined. <a href="https://www.seatlabnft.com/about">SeatlabNFT</a>, an NFT ticketing platform built on the NEAR blockchain, is bringing fans closer to their favorite artists and sports teams, while also making the ticketing game a lot fairer by reducing scalping and touting.</p>



<p>NFTs in sports and entertainment are becoming more widespread and high-profile. Professional athletes and musicians love flexing their profile pic NFTs these days. But there are more meaningful ways to use NFT technology in the Web3 space. This is precisely SeatlabNFT’s aim: use NFTs and the underlying technology to revolutionize ticketing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-nfts-can-make-ticketing-fairer">How NFTs can make ticketing fairer</h2>



<p>A major long-standing issue in the ticketing industry is control over the secondary market. Tickets to popular events often sell out in a matter of minutes—often due to scalpers and ticket wholesalers—only to reappear on the secondary market at a significant markup. It’s an unfortunate reality that many music and sports fans have come to accept.</p>



<p>“While various ideas to beat scalpers have been tried in the past, Web2 lacks the tools required to provide genuine control over the secondary market,” wrote Ryan Kenny, CEO of SeatlabNFT, in a <a href="https://www.cityam.com/nft-ticketing-is-inevitable-and-its-more-than-just-a-form-of-access-control/">recent op-ed for City A.M</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The result, in many cases, is that fans are unable to see the performers they love without paying extortionate amounts of money,” he added. “And, with the profit falling into the hands of scalpers, artists miss out on any revenue generated by secondary sales.”</p>



<p>The SeatlabNFT live event and ticketing platform, built on NEAR, has a clear plan to solve those issues. Artists will be able to mint and sell tickets directly to fans on SeatlabNFT, while those who purchase will avoid scalper markups. And unlike buying a ticket in today’s secondary market, NFT technology will ensure that the ticket they buy isn’t fraudulent.</p>



<p>“With the arrival of Web3, there is a huge opportunity to change this dynamic by issuing tickets as NFTs,” wrote Kenny. “NFT technology is a natural fit for ticketing, as it solves many main problems plaguing the event ticketing industry.”</p>



<p>But maintaining fair pricing and putting more revenue into the pockets of creators themselves is just the tip of the iceberg. SeatlabNFT has other ideas for how to use NFTs to change the ticketing landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-more-profound-relationships-with-fans">Creating more profound relationships with fans</h2>



<p>SeatlabNFT has big plans to help artists and teams make the fan experience much more fun, immersive, and bi-directional. Fans and attendees will feel less like consumers being sold an experience, and more like active participants. SeatlabNFT’s NFT platform will open doors and opportunities to increase fan engagement and loyalty.</p>



<p>For starters, artists will be able to create, issue, and sell NFT collectibles associated with various live events. This goes beyond images, as NFTs can also exist on the blockchain in the form of audio recordings, videos, and other forms of digital artwork. These event-associated NFTs could be airdropped on demand, displayed online, or traded with the same smart contracts used to control the secondary market for tickets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creators can also airdrop event-based NFTs or collectibles using SeatlabNFT smart contracts, rewarding some of the best and most loyal fans who attend live events. For instance, a musical artist could airdrop NFTs to fans who have been to multiple live shows, with their attendance verified by the blockchain. This gives creators the chance to issue everything from digital collectibles to utility NFTs that grant things like discounts on merch, early access to future sales or even unlock on-site perks like access to restricted areas or free food and drink.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ticket royalty splits and price ceilings </h2>



<p>Underpinning all of these NFT ticketing value propositions is SeatlabNFT’s smart contracts that enable royalty splits (on NEAR, royalty splits are baked into smart contracts) and price ceilings. Royalty splits and price ceilings give artists and event organizers the tools they need to fight back against scalping. It allows creators to configure the tickets before they go on sale, and ensures that even on the secondary market, event creators can still capture the value they create.  </p>



<p>With these cutting-edge ticketing efforts, SeatlabNFT is working to create a fairer, more transparent, and equitable playing field for all parties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-seatlabnft">What’s next for SeatlabNFT</h2>



<p>SeatlabNFT is currently in Phase 2 of its roadmap, with a variety of features and functions already live. The SeatlabNFT app is downloadable on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, with tickets to various events currently on sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SeatlabNFT membership card available on the app is also a precursor to the <a href="http://www.seatlabnft.com/blog/how-immersive-fan-passes-can-engage-fans-globally">Immersive Fan Pass</a>, an NFT-based fan membership card program exclusively on SeatlabNFT. These passes will be NFTs with various tiered utility and benefits that artists can offer as part of an immersive fan club package. Backstage passes, early access to demo tracks, and artist meet-and-greets are just a few potential ways the Immersive Fan Pass could be used.</p>



<p>SeatlabNFT also just <a href="https://twitter.com/SeatlabNFT/status/1584952941773045763?s=20&amp;t=RLtGCj4N4mDndStMl_byLw">announced</a> a new partnership with Elrow, one of the world’s biggest dance brands. At Elrow’s Dubai festival, scheduled for February 18, 2023 , SeatlabNFT technology will be used for exclusive VIP ticketing and immersive experiences. Elrow Dubai is taking place at D3 Dubai Design District, which can accommodate up to 10,000 people, making it a great opportunity to onboard many new people into both NEAR and Web3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">VIP tickets for <a href="https://twitter.com/elrow_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elrow_</a> Dubai will be available exclusively via SeatlabNFT from 02.11.22 🐙<br><br>This is going to be a unique immersive experience you won’t want to miss… <a href="https://t.co/o8S5DSHuQb">pic.twitter.com/o8S5DSHuQb</a></p>&mdash; Seatlab 🎟️ (@SeatlabOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeatlabOfficial/status/1584952941773045763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The ticketing industry and experience are long overdue for disruption, and SeatlabNFT is well on the way to doing just that. Artists, creators, and sports teams can offer more fair pricing to their fans while receiving a greater share of the revenue via SeatlabNFT’s royalty split smart contracts. And fans get better pricing with the peace of mind that they’re purchasing an authentic ticket.</p>



<p>And even more exciting, integrating NFT technology into the ticketing space opens the door for limitless possibilities in connecting fans with their favorite artists and teams. Linking exclusive digital NFT collectibles and airdrops with tickets is ripe for experimentation, and the Immersive Fan Pass will engage fans on a level never before seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://nft.hiphop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT.HipHop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketplace auction of the Hip Hop Heads collection began on Juneteenth and will run for 37 days, until July 25. A celebration of the history of hip hop and its most iconic artists, the pop-up marketplace also highlights some engineering innovations that highlight the advanced NFT developer and user experience on NEAR. NFT.HipHop incorporates seamless NEAR account creation, the ability to purchase NFTs with a credit card, customizable royalty splits that follow NFTs across marketplaces, and the debut of NFTs displaying in the NEAR wallet. </span></p>
<h3>Inside the User Experience</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFT.HipHop auction marks a radical change in the way that NFT marketplaces can be executed. The user onboarding flow makes the process universally accessible and as familiar as any Web2 purchasing experience. With this new creative approach, end users with no existing crypto knowledge can easily purchase NFTs without the hurdles of onboarding to an exchange, purchasing cryptocurrency, or choosing and connecting a wallet. Thanks to the app’s wallet faucet and NEAR’s human-rea</span>dable account naming system, all a user has to do is choose a NEAR name and the application handles the rest.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12737" src="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inside-nfthiphop-ux.png" alt="" width="1400" height="520" srcset="https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inside-nfthiphop-ux.png 1400w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inside-nfthiphop-ux-300x111.png 300w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inside-nfthiphop-ux-1024x380.png 1024w, https://pages.near.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inside-nfthiphop-ux-768x285.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplace credits for placing NFT bids can be purchased with a credit card. There is no complex, multi-step process of purchasing crypto through an exchan</span>ge and paying high transaction fees as would be required with other NFT marketplaces today. Using crypto can be a confusing process for a novice, but by employing this progressive onboarding flow, the barrier to entry for crypto has been all but eliminated. The goal is to make NFTs accessible to all kinds of hip hop fans, not just crypto-native fans.</p>
<h3>Inside the App</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, the NFT.HipHop marketplace is a standard React application with state management. dApp developers retrieve on-chain state using the NEAR API Helper, which interacts with the NEAR blockchain via CloudFlare. This tool allows caching heavy queries when the user lands on the page, as there are 103 portraits in the Hip Hop Heads collection and 37 available editions of each Head. As the user explores the marketplace, they’re only viewing one basic type of NFT. The canonical tokens, or “gem tokens,” are stored, and individual edition bids and sales are visible to the user within each gem. When clicking on an individual token, one sees which editions are for sale and the bidding history is pulled from the marketplace contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the user is ready to bid on an NFT, a React component handles the flow of creating a NEAR account; if you already have a NEAR Wallet, you go straight to buying credits. Then the user gets a prompt to add “credits” to their account using </span><a href="https://stripe.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This happens through a custom-built </span><a href="https://github.com/mehtaphysical/stripe-pay-sandbox"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stripe-payment-sandbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which converts fiat into credits that are actually native fungible tokens usable only on the NFT.HipHop app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Stripe payment fiat onramp is accomplished by wrapping the fungible token standard with a </span><a href="https://github.com/mehtaphysical/stripe-pay-sandbox/blob/main/contract/src/lib.rs#L197-L221"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom API</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure that only transfers to the marketplace or started by the marketplace are possible, in addition to tracking Stripe charges used to mint the tokens. The latter makes it possible to automate refunds when the auction concludes. The standard contract methods are wrapped so that an “assertion” can be added, verifying that transfer requests involve the marketplace. If the assertion fails, the smart contract will “panic,” displaying an alert indicating that “only transfers from the marketplace are allowed.”</span></p>
<h3>Inside NFT Royalties on NEAR</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all of the backend accounting is done transparently on the blockchain and is visible on </span><a href="https://explorer.nearpages.wpengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEAR Explorer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing for transparency paired with a real ability to illustrate the flow of funds. Using the </span><a href="https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Payout.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard for a Multiple-Recipient-Payout mechanic on NFT Contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, royalties on NEAR follow the NFTs in perpetuity. This allows for royalty enforcement across different marketplaces and applies to secondary sales. A user could have an NFT in their NEAR wallet and go to a different marketplace on NEAR, such as </span><a href="https://paras.id/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paras</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.mintbase.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mintbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for a potential resale. With the royalties embedded in the actual NFT token, they must be respected in order to complete the transfer of that NFT. Completely customizable, royalties can be split between multiple contributors, beneficiaries, and even DAOs. This standard is the first of its kind and a key differentiator for NFT developers, artists, and users alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the 36-day marketplace draws to a close, every auction winner will see their NFT displayed in their NEAR wallet––in fact, all NEAR NFTs from any marketplace are displayed in a collectibles tab in the wallet. Like art hanging on a gallery wall or in your home, the user’s collection is accessible within a few clicks, and not just within an individual marketplace. </span></p>
<h3>Inspired? Start Building!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting documentation and open source repositories for building NFT marketplaces on NEAR are available to all. Any developer can utilize the concepts in this marketplace and model their dApps on this construct or remix different elements as part of a new idea. Head over to </span><a href="http://nft.hiphop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFT.HipHop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see how NEAR’s seamless and easy tech can empower builders to create accessible, delightful user experiences.</span></p>
